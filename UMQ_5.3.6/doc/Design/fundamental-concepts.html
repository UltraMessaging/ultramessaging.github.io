Fundamental Concepts</a></h1>

<p>A <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> application can function either as a <i
class="FIRSTTERM">source</i> or a <i class="FIRSTTERM">receiver</i>. A source application
sends messages, and a receiver application receives them. (It is also common for an
application to function as <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">both</i></span>
source and receiver; we separate the concepts for organizational purposes.)</p>

<h2 class="SECTION"><a id="TOPICS" name="TOPICS">2.1. Topic Structure and
Management</a></h2>

<p><b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> offers the <i class="FIRSTTERM">Publish/Subscribe</i>
model for messaging ("Pub/Sub"), whereby one or more receiver programs express interest
in a <i class="FIRSTTERM">topic</i>, and one or more source programs send to that topic.
So, a topic can be thought of as a data stream that can have multiple producers and
multiple consumers. One of the functions of the messaging layer is to make sure that all
messages sent to a given topic are distributed to all receivers listening to that topic.
<b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> does this through an automatic process known as <i
class="FIRSTTERM">topic resolution</i>.</p>

<p>A topic is just an arbitrary string. For example:</p>

<table border="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Deals</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Market/US/DJIA/Sym1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>It is not unusual for an application system to have many thousands of topics, perhaps
even more than a million, with each one carrying a very specific range of information
(e.g. quotes for a single stock symbol).</p>

<p>It is also possible to configure receiving programs to match multiple topics using
wildcards. <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> uses powerful regular expression pattern
matching to allow applications to match topics in a very flexible way. At the present
time, messages cannot be <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">sent</i></span> to
wildcarded topic names. See <a href="lbm-objects.html#WILDCARD-RECEIVER"><i>Wildcard
Receiver</i></a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECTION">
<h2 class="SECTION"><a id="PERSISTENCE" name="PERSISTENCE">2.2. Persistence</a></h2>

<p><b class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> - which contains the <b class="APPLICATION"><span
class="TRADEMARK">Ultra Messaging</span>&reg;</b> <b class="APPLICATION">Streaming
Edition</b> (<b class="APPLICATION">UMS</b>) functionality - includes a component known
as the <i class="FIRSTTERM">persistent store</i>, which provides stable storage (disk or
memory) of message streams. <b class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> delivers a persisted message
stream to receiving applications with no additional latency in the vast majority of
cases. This offers the functionality of durable subscriptions and confirmed message
delivery. <b class="APPLICATION"><span class="TRADEMARK">Ultra Messaging</span></b>
streaming applications build and run with the <b class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> persistence
feature without modification. See <a href="../UME/index.html" target="doccontent">The Ultra
Messaging Guide for Persistence and Queuing</a> for more information.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECTION">
<h2 class="SECTION"><a id="QUEUING" name="QUEUING">2.3. Queuing</a></h2>

<p><b class="APPLICATION">UMQ</b> - which contains both the <b class="APPLICATION"><span
class="TRADEMARK">Ultra Messaging</span></b> <b class="APPLICATION">Streaming Edition</b>
(<b class="APPLICATION">UMS</b>) functionality and the <b class="APPLICATION"><span
class="TRADEMARK">Ultra Messaging</span></b> <b class="APPLICATION">Persistence
Edition</b> (<b class="APPLICATION">UMP</b>) functionality - includes message queuing
capabilities that allows sources to submit messages asynchronously to a queue and permits
receivers to retrieve messages from a queue in an entirely different asynchronous manner.
<b class="APPLICATION">UMQ</b> also supports Once and Only Once (OAOO) delivery and
Application Sets that allow you to load balance processing or support multiple processing
purposes for single topics. See <a href="../UME/index.html" target="doccontent">The Ultra
Messaging Guide for Persistence and Queuing</a> for more information.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECTION">
<h2 class="SECTION"><a id="LATE-JOIN" name="LATE-JOIN">2.4. Late Join</a></h2>

<p>In many applications, a new receiver may be interested in messages that were sent
before it existed. <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> provides a late join feature that allows
a new receiver to join a group of others already listening to a source. Without the late
join feature, the joining receiver would only receive messages sent after the time it
joined. With late join, the source stores sent messages according to its Late Join
configuration options so a joining receiver can receive any of these messages that were
sent before it joined the group. See <a href="lbm-features.html#USING-LATE-JOIN"><i>Using
Late Join</i></a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECTION">
<h2 class="SECTION"><a id="REQUEST-RESPONSE" name="REQUEST-RESPONSE">2.5.
Request/Response</a></h2>

<p><b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> also offers a <i class="FIRSTTERM">Request/Response</i>
messaging model. A sending application (the requester) sends a message to a topic. Every
receiving application listening to that topic gets a copy of the request. One or more of
those receiving applications (responder) can then send one or more responses back to the
original requester. <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> sends the request message via the
normal pub/sub method, whereas <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> delivers the response
message directly to the requester.</p>

<p>An important aspect of <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b>'s Request/Response model is that
it allows the application to keep track of which request corresponds to a given response.
Due to the asynchronous nature of <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> requests, any number of
requests can be outstanding, and as the responses come in, they can be matched to their
corresponding requests.</p>

<p>Request/Response can be used in many ways and is often used during the initialization
of <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> receiver objects. When an application starts a receiver,
it can issue a request on the topic the receiver is interested in. Source objects for the
topic can respond and begin publishing data. This method prevents the <b
class="APPLICATION">UM</b> source objects from publishing to a topic without
subscribers.</p>

<p>Be careful not to be confused with the sending/receiving terminology. Any application
can send a request, including one that creates and manages <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b>
receiver objects. And any application can receive and respond to a request, including one
that creates and manages <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> source objects.</p>

<p>See <a href="lbm-features.html#REQUEST-RESPONSE-MESSAGES"><i>Request/Response
Model</i></a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECTION">
<h2 class="SECTION"><a id="TRANSPORTS" name="TRANSPORTS">2.6. Transports</a></h2>

<p>A source application uses an <i class="FIRSTTERM">UMS transport</i> to send messages
to a receiver application. A <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> transport is built on top of a
standard IP protocol. The different <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> transport types have
different tradeoffs in terms of latency, scalability, throughput, bandwidth sharing, and
flexibility. The sending application chooses the transport type that is most appropriate
for the data being sent, at the topic level. A programmer might choose different
transport types for different topics within the same application.</p>

<p>A <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> sending application can make use of very many topics
(over a million). <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> maps those topics onto a much smaller
number of <i class="FIRSTTERM">transport sessions</i>. A transport session can be thought
of as a specific instance of a transport type. A given transport session might carry a
single topic, or might carry hundreds of thousands of topics. A receiving application may
express interest in a small set of those topics, in which case <b
class="APPLICATION">UM</b> will join the transport session, receiving messages for <span
class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">all</i></span> topics carried on that transport
session. <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> will then discard any messages for topics that the
application is not interested in. This <i class="FIRSTTERM">user-space filtering</i> does
consume system resources (primarily CPU and bandwidth), and can be minimized by carefully
mapping topics onto transport sessions according to receiving application interest.</p>

<div class="NOTE">
<blockquote class="NOTE">
<p><b>Note:</b> Non-multicast <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> transport types can also use
<i class="FIRSTTERM">source-side filtering</i> to decrease user-space filtering on the
receiving side by doing the filtering on the sending side. However, while this might
sound attractive at first glance, be aware that system resources consumed on the source
side affect <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">all</i></span> receivers, and that
the filtering for multiple receivers must be done serially, whereas letting the receivers
do the filtering allows that filtering to be done in parallel, only affecting those
receivers that need the filtering.</p>

<div class="SECTION">
<h3 class="SECTION"><a id="MULTITHREADED-TRANSPORTS"
name="MULTITHREADED-TRANSPORTS">2.6.1. Multi-Transport Threads</a></h3>

<p>Part of <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b>'s design is a single threaded model for message
data delivery which reduces latency in the receiving CPU. <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b>,
however, also has the ability to distribute data delivery across multiple CPUs by using a
receiving thread pool. Receivers created with the configuration option, <a
href="../Config/majoroptions.html#RECEIVERUSETRANSPORTTHREAD" target="doccontent"><tt
class="LITERAL">use_transport_thread</tt></a> set to <b class="APPLICATION">1</b> use a
thread from the thread pool instead of the context thread. The option, <a
href="../Config/majoroptions.html#CONTEXTRECEIVETHREADPOOLSIZE" target="doccontent"><tt
class="LITERAL">receive_thread_pool_size</tt></a> controls the pool size.</p>

<p>As receivers discover new sources through Topic Resolution, <b
class="APPLICATION">UM</b> assigns the network sockets created for the receivers to
receive data to either the context thread (default) or to a thread from the pool if <a
href="../Config/majoroptions.html#RECEIVERUSETRANSPORTTHREAD" target="doccontent"><tt
class="LITERAL">use_transport_thread</tt></a> is set for the receiver. It is important to
understand that thread assignment occurs at the socket level - not the transport level.
Transports aggregated on to the same network socket use the same thread.</p>

<p><b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> distributes data from different sockets to different
threads allowing better process distribution and higher aggregate throughput.
Distributing transports across threads also ensures that activity on each transport has
no impact on transports assigned to other threads leading to lower latencies in some
traffic patterns, e.g. heavy loss conditions.</p>

<p>The following lists restrictions to using multi-transport threads.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Only <a href="../Design/lbm-objects.html#TRANSPORT-LBT-RM" target="doccontent">LBT-RM</a>,
<a href="../Design/lbm-objects.html#TRANSPORT-LBT-RU" target="doccontent">LBT-RU</a>, <a
href="../Design/lbm-objects.html#TRANSPORT-TCP" target="doccontent">TCP</a> and <a
href="../Design/lbm-objects.html#TRANSPORT-TCP-LB" target="doccontent">TCP-LB</a> transport
types may be distributed to threads.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Multi-Transport threads are not supported under <a
href="../Config/majoroptions.html#CONTEXTOPERATIONALMODE" target="doccontent"><tt
class="LITERAL">sequential mode</tt></a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> processes sources using the same transport socket, e.g.
multicast address and port, on the same thread (regardless of the <a
href="../Config/majoroptions.html#RECEIVERUSETRANSPORTTHREAD" target="doccontent"><tt
class="LITERAL">use_transport_thread</tt></a> setting. To leverage threading of different
sources, assign each source to a different transport destination, e.g. multicast
address/port.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Hot failover sources using LBT-RM on the same topic must not be distributed across
threads because they must share the same multicast address and port.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Hot failover sources using other transport types may not be distributed across threads
and must use the context thread.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Each transport thread has its own Unicast Listener (request) port. <b
class="APPLICATION"><span class="TRADEMARK">Ultra Messaging</span></b> recommends that
you expand the range <a
href="../Config/requestnetworkoptions.html#CONTEXTREQUESTTCPPORTLOW" target="doccontent"><tt
class="LITERAL">request_tcp_port_low</tt></a> - <a
href="../Config/requestnetworkoptions.html#CONTEXTREQUESTTCPPORTHIGH" target="doccontent"><tt
class="LITERAL">request_tcp_port_high</tt></a> to a larger range when using transport
threads. When late join is occurring, <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> creates a TCP
connection from the transport thread to the source.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Multi-transport threads are not recommended for use over the UM Gateway.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Multi-Transport Threads do not support persistent stores (<b
class="APPLICATION">UMP</b>) or persistent receivers</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Multi-Transport Threads do not support queues (<b class="APPLICATION">UMQ</b>) or
queing receivers.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Multi-Transport Threads are not compatible with UMDS Server or <b
class="APPLICATION">UMCache</b></p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="SECTION">
<h2 class="SECTION"><a id="EVENT-DELIVERY" name="EVENT-DELIVERY">2.7. Event
Delivery</a></h2>

<p>There are many different <i class="FIRSTTERM">events</i> that <b
class="APPLICATION">UM</b> may want to deliver to the application. Many events carry data
with them (e.g. received messages); some do not (e.g. end-of-stream events). Some
examples of <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> events:</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>A received message on a topic that the application has expressed interest in.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A timer expiring. Applications can schedule timers to expire in a desired number of
milliseconds (although the OS may not deliver them with millisecond precision).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>An application-managed file descriptor event. The application can register its own
file descriptors with <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> to be monitored for state changes
(readable, writable, error, etc).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>New source notification. <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> can inform the application when
sources are discovered by topic resolution.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Receiver loss. <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> can inform the application when a data
gap is detected that could not be recovered through the normal retransmission
mechanism.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>End of Stream. <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> can inform a receiving application when a
data stream (transport session) has terminated.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> delivers events to the application by <i
class="FIRSTTERM">callbacks</i>. The application explicitly gives <b
class="APPLICATION">UM</b> a pointer to one of its functions to be the handler for a
particular event, and <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> calls that function to deliver the
event, passing it the parameters that the application requires to process the event. In
particular, the last parameter of each callback type is a <i class="FIRSTTERM">client
data pointer</i> (<code class="PARAMETER">clientdp</code>). This pointer can be used at
the application's discretion for any purpose. It's value is specified by the application
when the callback function is identified to <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> (typically when
<b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> objects are created), and that same value is passed back to
the application when the callback function is called.</p>

<p>There are two methods that <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> can use to call the
application callbacks: through <i class="FIRSTTERM">context thread callback</i>, or <i
class="FIRSTTERM">event queue dispatch</i>.</p>

<p>In the context thread callback method (sometimes called <i class="FIRSTTERM">direct
callback</i>), the <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> context thread calls the application
function directly. This offers the lowest latency, but imposes significant restrictions
on the application function. See <a href="lbm-objects.html#EVENT-QUEUE-OBJECT"><i>Event
Queue Object</i></a>.</p>

<p>The event queue dispatch of application callback introduces a dynamic buffer into
which the <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> context thread writes events. The application
then uses a thread of its own to dispatch the buffered events. Thus, the application
callback functions are called from the application thread, not directly from the context
thread.</p>

<p>With event queue dispatching, the use of the application thread to make the callback
allows the application function to make full, unrestricted use of the <b
class="APPLICATION">UM</b> API. It also allows parallel execution of <b
class="APPLICATION">UM</b> processing and application processing, which can significantly
improve throughput on multi-processor hardware. The dynamic buffering provides resilience
between the rate of event generation and the rate of event consumption (e.g. message
arrival rate v.s. message processing rate).</p>

<p>In addition, an <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> event queue allows the application to be
warned when the queue exceeds a threshold of event count or event latency. This allows
the application to take corrective action if it is running too slow, such as throwing
away all events older than a threshold, or all events that are below a given
priority.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECTION">
<h2 class="SECTION"><a id="RATE-CONTROLS" name="RATE-CONTROLS">2.8. Rate
Controls</a></h2>

<p>For UDP-based transports (LBT-RU and LBT-RM), <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> network
stability is insured through the use of <i class="FIRSTTERM">rate controls</i>. Without
rate controls, sources can send UDP data so fast that the network can be flooded. Using
rate controls, the source's bandwidth usage is limited. If the source attempts to exceed
its bandwidth allocation, it is slowed down.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECTION">
<h2 class="SECTION"><a id="OPERATIONAL-STATISTICS" name="OPERATIONAL-STATISTICS">2.9.
Operational Statistics</a></h2>

<p><b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> maintains a variety of transport-level statistics which
gives a real-time snapshot of <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b>'s internal handling. For
example, it gives counts for transport messages transferred, bytes transferred,
retransmissions requested, unrecoverable loss, etc.</p>

<p>The <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> <i class="FIRSTTERM">monitoring</i> API provides
framework to allow the convenient gathering and transmission of <b
class="APPLICATION">UM</b> statistics to a central monitoring point. See <a
href="monitoring.html"><i>Monitoring UMS</i></a>.</p>
