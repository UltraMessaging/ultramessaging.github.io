<p>We begin with the minimal source and receiver used by the <a
href="../QuickStart/index.html" target="doccontent">QuickStart Guide</a>. To more easily
demonstrate the <b class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> features we are interested in, we have
modified the QuickStart source and receiver in the following ways.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Modified the source to send 20 messages with a one second pause between each
message</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Modified the receiver to anticipate 20 messages instead of just one</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Assigned the topic, UME Queue Example, to both the source and receiver</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Modified the receiver to not exit on unexpected receiver events</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The last change allows us to better demonstrate basic operation and evolve our
receiver slowly without having to anticipate all the options that <b
class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> provides up front.</p>

class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> Store to a Source</a></h2>

<p>The fundamental component of a <b class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> persistence solution is
the persistent store. To use a store, a source needs to be configured to use one by
setting <a href="../Config/ultramessagingpersistenceoptions.html#SOURCEUMESTORE"
target="doccontent"><tt class="LITERAL">ume_store</tt></a> for the source. We can do that with
the following piece of code.</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
err = lbm_src_topic_attr_str_setopt(&amp;attr, "ume_store", "127.0.0.1:14567");
</pre>

<p>This sets the <b class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> persistent store for the source to the
store running at 127.0.0.1 on port 14567.</p>

<div class="NOTE">
<blockquote class="NOTE">
<p><b>Note:</b> If you desire to run a store on a different machine than where the source

<p>After adding the ume-store specification to the source, perform the following
steps.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>Create the cache and state directories. <tt class="LITERAL">$ mkdir umestored-cache ;
mkdir umestored-state</tt></p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Start up the store. <tt class="LITERAL">$ umestored ume-example-config.xml</tt></p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Start the Receiver. <tt class="LITERAL">$ ume-example-rcv</tt></p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Start the Source. <tt class="LITERAL">$ ume-example-src</tt></p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>You should see a message on the source that says:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
INFO: Source "UME Example" Late Join not set, but UME store specified. Setting Late Join.
</pre>

<p>This is an informational message from <b class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> and merely means
Late Join was not set and that <b class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> is going to set it.</p>

<p>Notice that the receiver was not configured with any store information. That is
because setting it on the source is all that is needed. The receiver learns <b
class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> store settings from the source through the normal <b
class="APPLICATION">UM</b> topic resolution process. Receivers don't need to do anything
special to leverage the usage of a store by a source.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECTION">
<h2 class="SECTION"><a id="TUTORIAL-ADDINGFAULTRECOVERY"
name="TUTORIAL-ADDINGFAULTRECOVERY">5.3. Adding Fault Recovery with Registration
IDs</a></h2>

<p>If the source or receiver crashes, how does the source and receiver tell the store
that they have restarted and wish to resume where they left off? We need to add in some
sort of identifiers to the source and receiver so that the store knows which sources and
receivers they are.</p>

<p>In <b class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> , these identifiers are called Registration IDs or
RegIDs. <b class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> allows the application to control the use of
RegIDs as it wishes. This allows applications to migrate sources and receivers not just
between systems, but between locations with true, unprecedented freedom. However, <b
class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> requires an application to be careful of how it uses RegIDs.
Specifically, an application must not use the same RegID for multiple sources and/or
receivers at the same time.</p>

<p>Now let's look at how we can use RegIDs to provide complete fault recovery of sources
and receivers. We'll first handle RegIDs in the simplest manner by using static IDs for
our source and receiver. For the source, the RegID of 1000 can be added to the existing
store specification by changing the string to</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
127.0.0.1:14567:1000
</pre>

<p>This yields the source code in <a href="ume-example-src-2.c"
target="doccontent">ume-example-src-2.c</a></p>

<p>For the receiver, we accomplish this in two steps.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>Set a callback function to be called when we desire to set the RegID to 1100. This is
done by declaring the callback function, <tt class="LITERAL">app_rcv_regid_callback</tt>,
which will return the RegID value 1100 to <b class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> .</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Inform the <b class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> configuration for the receiver to use this
callback function. That is accomplished by setting the <a
href="../Config/ultramessagingpersistenceoptions.html#RECEIVERUMEREGISTRATIONEXTENDEDFUNCTION"
 target="doccontent"><tt class="LITERAL">ume_registration_extended_function</tt></a> similar to
example code below.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<pre class="SCREEN">
lbm_ume_rcv_regid_ex_func_t id;      /* structure to hold registration function information */
id.func = app_rcv_regid_callback;    /* the callback function to call */
id.clientd = NULL;                   /* the value to pass in the clientd to the function */
err = lbm_rcv_topic_attr_setopt(&amp;attr, "ume_registration_extended_function", &amp;id, sizeof(id));
         
</pre>

<p>Once this is done, the receiver has the ability to control what RegID it will use.
This yields the source code in <a href="ume-example-rcv-2.c"
target="doccontent">ume-example-rcv-2.c</a>.</p>

<p>With these in place, you can experiment with killing the receiver and bringing it back
(as long as you bring it back before the source is finished), as well as killing the
source and bringing it back.</p>

<p>The restriction to this initial approach to RegIDs is that the RegIDs 1000 and 1100
may not be used by any other objects at the same time. If you run additional sources or
receivers, they must be assigned new RegIDs, not 1000 or 1100. Let's now take a more
sophisticated approach to RegIDs that will allow much more flexibility</p>
</div>

<div class="SECTION">
<h2 class="SECTION"><a id="TUTORIAL-PERSISTENCESOURCESTORE"
name="TUTORIAL-PERSISTENCESOURCESTORE">5.4. Enabling Persistence Between the Source and
Store</a></h2>

<p>Let's refine our source to include some desired behavior following a crash. Upon
restart, we want our source to resume with the first unsent message. For example, if the
source sent 10 messages and crashed, we want our source to resume with the 11th message
and continue until it has sent the 20th message.</p>

<p>Accomplishing this graceful resumption requires us to ensure that our source is the
only source that uses the RegID assigned to it. The same RegID should be used as long as
the source has not sent the 20th message regardless of any crashes that may occur. We can
do this with the following changes to the store:</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>Configure the store to assign a RegID when the source starts.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Configure the store to save the RegID to disk so that it can be used after a
crash.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>In addition to these two changes to the store's configuration, the following two
sections explain the changes needed for the source and receiver, which become fairly easy
due to the events that <b class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> delivers to the application during
<b class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> operation.</p>

<div class="NOTE">
<blockquote class="NOTE">
<p><b>Note:</b> While the following sections are instructive about how <b
class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> uses RegIDs to provide persistence, RegIDs can also be
managed easily with the use of Session IDs. See <a
href="designing-persistent-applications.html#SESSION-IDS"><i>Managing RegIDs with Session
IDs</i></a>.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>

<div class="SECTION">
<h2 class="SECTION"><a id="TUTORIAL-PERSISTENCESOURCE"
name="TUTORIAL-PERSISTENCESOURCE">5.5. Enabling Persistence in the Source</a></h2>

<p>With the above mentioned behaviors in mind, let's turn to looking at how they may be
implemented with <b class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> , starting with the source. We can
summarize the changes we need by the following list.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>At source startup, use any saved RegID information found in the file by setting
information in the <a
href="../Config/ultramessagingpersistenceoptions.html#SOURCEUMESTORE" target="doccontent"><tt
class="LITERAL">ume_store</tt></a> configuration variable.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>After the store registration is successful, if a new RegID was assigned to the source,
save the RegID to the file.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Set the message number to begin sending. Refer to the explanation below.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Send until message number 20 has been sent.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>After message 20 has been sent, delete the saved RegID file.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>For Step 3, if the source has just been initialized, the application starts with
message number 1. If the source has been restarted after a crash, the application looks
to <b class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> to establish the beginning message number because <b
class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> will use the next sequence number. For this simple example,
we can make the assumption that each message is one sequence number for <b
class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> and that <b class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> starts with sequence
number 0. Thus the application can set the message number it begins resending with the
value of the <b class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> sequence number + 1.</p>

<div class="NOTE">
<blockquote class="NOTE">
<p><b>Note:</b> Using sequence numbers to set the message number is a good practice if
you send messages smaller than 8K.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p>These changes yield the source code in <a href="ume-example-src-3.c"
target="doccontent">ume-example-src-3.c</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECTION">
<h2 class="SECTION"><a id="TUTORIAL-PERSISTENCERECEIVER"
name="TUTORIAL-PERSISTENCERECEIVER">5.6. Enabling Persistence in the Receiver</a></h2>

<p>Let's also refine the receiver to resume where it left off after a crash. Just as with
the source, the receiver can have the store assign it a RegID if the receiver is just
beginning. Once the receiver receives the 20th message from the source, it can get rid of
the RegID and exit. Because the receiver can receive some messages, crash, and come back,
we should only need to look at a message and check if it is the 20th message based on the
message contents or sequence number. <b class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> provides all the
events to the application that we need to create these behaviors in the receiver.</p>

<p>The receiver changes are summarized below.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>At receiver startup, use any saved RegID information found in the file for callback
information when needed.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>When RegID callback is called: Check to see if the source RegID matches the saved
source RegID. If it does, return the saved receiver RegID. RegID matches the saved source
RegID if so, return the saved receiver RegID.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>After store registration is successful: If not using a previously saved RegID, then
save the RegID assigned by the store to the source to a file, as well as the store
information and the source RegID.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>After the last message is received (message number 20 or <b
class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> sequence number 19), end the application and delete the saved
RegID file.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>RegIDs in <b class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> can be considered to be per source and per
topic. Thus the receiver does not want to use the wrong RegID for a different source on
the same topic. To avoid this, we save the source RegID and even store information so
that the <tt class="LITERAL">app_rcv_regid_callback</tt> can make sure to use the correct
RegID for the given source RegID. These changes yield the source code in <a
href="ume-example-rcv-3.c" target="doccontent">ume-example-rcvc-3.c</a></p>

<p>The above sources and receivers are simplified for illustration purposes and do have
some limitations. The receiver will only keep the information for one source at a time
saved to the file. This is fine for illustration purposes, but would be lacking in
completeness for production applications unless it was assured that a single source for
any topic would be in use. To extend the receiver to include several sources is simply a
matter of saving each to the file, reading them in at startup, and being able to search
for the correct one for each callback invoked.</p>
