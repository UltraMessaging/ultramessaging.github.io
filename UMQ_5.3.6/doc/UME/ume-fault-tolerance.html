Recovery</a></h2>

<p>Deployment decisions play a huge role in the success of any persistent system.
Configuration in <b class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> has a number of options that aid in
performance, fault recovery, and overall system stability. It is not possible, or at
least not wise, to totally divorce configuration from application development for high
performance systems. This is true not only for persistent systems, but for practically
all distributed systems. When designing systems, deployment considerations need to be
taken into account. This section discusses the following deployment considerations.</p>

<div class="SECTION">
<h3 class="SECTION"><a id="SOURCE-CONSIDERATIONS" name="SOURCE-CONSIDERATIONS">10.1.1.
Source Considerations</a></h3>

<p>Performance of sources is heavily impacted by:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>the release policy that the source uses</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>streaming methods of the source</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>the throughput and latency requirements of the data</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Source release settings have a direct impact on memory usage. As messages are
retained, they consume memory. You reclaim memory when you release messages. Message
stability, delivery confirmation and retention size all interact to create your release
policies. <b class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> provides a hard limit on the memory usage. When
exceeded, a Forced Reclamation event is delivered. Thus applications that anticipate
forced reclamations can handle them appropriately. See also <a
href="designing-persistent-applications.html#SOURCE-MESSAGE-RETENTION-AND-RELEASE"><i>Source
Message Retention and Release</i></a>.</p>

<p>How the source streams data has a direct impact on latency and throughput. One
streaming method sets a maximum, outstanding count of messages. Once reached, the source
does not send any more until message stability notifications come in to reduce the number
of outstanding messages. The <a href="../example/umesrc.c" target="doccontent"><tt
class="LITERAL">umesrc</tt></a> example program uses this mechanism to limit the speed of
a source to something a store can handle comfortably. This also provides a maximum bound
on recovery that can simplify handling of streaming source recovery.</p>

<p>The throughput and latency requirements of the data are normal <b
class="APPLICATION">UM</b> concerns. See <a href="../Design/index.html" target="doccontent"><b
class="APPLICATION"><span class="TRADEMARK">Ultra Messaging</span>&reg;</b> <b

<div class="SECTION">
<h3 class="SECTION"><a id="RECEIVER-CONSIDERATIONS"
name="RECEIVER-CONSIDERATIONS">10.1.2. Receiver Considerations</a></h3>

<p>In addition to the following, receiver performance shares the same considerations as
receivers during normal operation.</p>

<div class="SECTION">
<h4 class="SECTION"><a id="ACKNOWLEDGEMENT-GENERATION"
name="ACKNOWLEDGEMENT-GENERATION">10.1.2.1. Acknowledgement Generation</a></h4>

<p>Receivers in a persistence implementation of <b class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> send an a
message consumption acknowledgement to stores and the message source. Some applications
may want to control this acknowledgement explicitly themselves. In this case, <a
href="../Config/ultramessagingpersistenceoptions.html#RECEIVERUMEEXPLICITACKONLY"
target="doccontent"><tt class="LITERAL">ume_explicit_ack_only</tt></a> can be used.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECTION">
<h4 class="SECTION"><a id="CONTROLLING-RETRANSMISSION"
name="CONTROLLING-RETRANSMISSION">10.1.2.2. Controlling Retransmission</a></h4>

<p>Receivers in <b class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> during fault recovery are another matter
entirely. Receivers send retransmission requests and receive and process retransmissions.
Control over this process is crucial when handling very long recoveries, such as hundreds
of thousands or millions of messages. A receiver only sends a certain number of
retransmission requests at a time.</p>

<p>This means that a receiver will not, unless configured to with <a
href="../Config/latejoinoptions.html#RECEIVERRETRANSMITREQUESTOUTSTANDINGMAXIMUM"
target="doccontent"><tt class="LITERAL">retransmit_request_outstanding_maximum</tt></a>,
request everything at once. The value of the low sequence number (<a
href="designing-persistent-applications.html#RECEIVER-RECOVERY"><i>Receiver
Recovery</i></a>) has a direct impact on how many requests need to be handled. A
receiving application can decide to only handle the last X number of messages instead of
recovering them all using the option, <a
href="../Config/latejoinoptions.html#RECEIVERRETRANSMITREQUESTMAXIMUM" target="doccontent"><tt
class="LITERAL">retransmit_request_maximum</tt></a>. The timeout used between requests,
if the retransmission does not arrive, is totally controllable with <a
href="../Config/latejoinoptions.html#RECEIVERRETRANSMITREQUESTINTERVAL" target="doccontent"><tt
class="LITERAL">retransmit_request_interval</tt></a>. And the total time given to recover
all messages is also controllable.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECTION">
<h4 class="SECTION"><a id="RECOVERY-PROCESS" name="RECOVERY-PROCESS">10.1.2.3. Recovery
Process</a></h4>

<p>Theoretically, receivers can handle up to roughly 2 billion messages during recovery.
This limit is implied from the sequence number arithmetic and not from any other
limitation. For recovery, the crucial limiting factor is how a receiver processes and
handles retransmissions which come in as fast as <b class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> can
request them and a store can retransmit them. This is perhaps much faster than an
application can handle them. In this case, it is crucial to realize that as recovery
progresses, the source may still be transmitting new data. This data will be buffered
until recovery is complete and then handed to the application. It is prudent to
understand application processing load when planning on how much recovery is going to be
needed and how it may need to be configured within <b class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> .</p>

<div class="SECTION">
<h3 class="SECTION"><a id="STORE-CONFIGURATION-CONSIDERATIONS"
name="STORE-CONFIGURATION-CONSIDERATIONS">10.1.3. Store Configuration
Considerations</a></h3>

<p><b class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> stores have numerous configuration options. See <a
href="umestored-config.html"><i>Configuration Reference for Umestored</i></a>. This
section presents issues relating to these options.</p>

<div class="SECTION">
<h4 class="SECTION"><a id="CONFIGURING-STORE-USAGE-PER-SOURCE"
name="CONFIGURING-STORE-USAGE-PER-SOURCE">10.1.3.1. Configuring Store Usage per
Source</a></h4>

<p>A store handles persisted state on a per topic per source basis. Based on the load of
topics and sources, it may be prudent to spread the topic space, or just source space,
across stores as a way to handle large loads. As configuration of store usage is per
source, this is extremely easy to do. It is easy to spread CPU load via multi-threading
as well as hard disk usage across stores. A single store process can have a set of
virtual stores within it, each with their own thread.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECTION">
<h4 class="SECTION"><a id="DISK-VS.-MEMORY" name="DISK-VS.-MEMORY">10.1.3.2. Disk vs.
Memory</a></h4>

<p>As mentioned previously in <a
href="designing-persistent-applications.html#UME-STORES"><i>UMP Stores</i></a>, stores
can be memory based or disk based. Disk stores also have the ability to spread hard disk
usage across multiple physical disks by using multiple virtual stores within a single
store process. This gives great flexibility on a per source basis for spreading data
reception and persistent data load.</p>

<p><b class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> stores provide settings for controlling memory usage
and for caching messages for retransmission in memory as well as on disk. See <a
href="umestored-config.html#UMESTORED-TOPIC-OPTIONS"><i>Options for a Topic's
ume-attributes Element</i></a>. All messages in a store, whether in memory or on disk,
have some small memory state. This is roughly about 72 bytes per message. For very large
caches of messages, this can become non-trivial in size.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECTION">
<h4 class="SECTION"><a id="ACTIVITY-TIMEOUTS" name="ACTIVITY-TIMEOUTS">10.1.3.3. Activity
Timeouts</a></h4>

<p><b class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> stores are NOT archives and are not designed for
archival. Stores persist source and receiver state with the aim of providing fault
recovery. Central to this is the concept that a source or receiver has an activity
timeout attached to it. Once a source or receiver suspends operation or has a failure, it
has a set time before the store will forget about it. This activity timeout needs to be
long enough to handle the recovery demands of sources and receivers. However, it can not
and should not be infinite. Each source takes up memory and disk space, therefore an
appropriate timeout should be chosen that meets the requirements of recovery, but is not
excessively long so that the limited resources of the store are exhausted.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="SECTION">
<h3 class="SECTION"><a id="UME-CONFIGURATIONS" name="UME-CONFIGURATIONS">10.1.4. <b
class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> Configuration Examples</a></h3>

<p>The following example configurations are offered to illustrate some of the many
options available to configuring <b class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> .</p>

<div class="SECTION">
<h4 class="SECTION"><a id="UME-CONFIGURATION-NAT-FIREWALL"
name="UME-CONFIGURATION-NAT-FIREWALL">10.1.4.1. <b class="APPLICATION">UMP</b>
Configuration with NAT/Firewall</a></h4>

<p>Although the diagram, <a
href="ume-ops-operational-view.html#UME-OPS-NORMAL-OPERATION"><i>Normal
Operation</i></a>, demonstrates the typical message interaction in <b
class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> , sources, receivers, and stores may be arranged in almost
limitless configurations. Some configurations make more sense than others for certain
situations. One of those situations involves a Network Address Translation configuration
(NAT) and/or Firewall. In such configurations, the source is the key element behind the
NAT or Firewall. Although not the only viable NAT/Firewall configuration for <b
class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> , the figure below demonstrates one approach to such an
arrangement.</p>

<div class="FIGURE"><a id="UMECONFIGFIREWALL" name="UMECONFIGFIREWALL"></a>
<p><b>Figure 17. UMP Configuration with NAT/Firewall</b></p>

<p><img src="UMEConfigFirewall.png" align="CENTER" /></p>
</div>

<p>The <tt class="LITERAL">lbmrd</tt> (29west Resolution Daemon) is an optional piece,
but used in most situations where a NAT or Firewall is involved. It provides unicast
support for topic resolution. The <tt class="LITERAL">lbmrd</tt> and the store are placed
on the outside (or at least are non-NATed or on a DMZ). Important characteristics of this
configuration are:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The LBMRD acts as a proxy for the topic resolution information.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The store is accessible by the source and receiver directly.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In this situation, receivers and stores unicast control information back to the
source, therefore the NAT or Firewall router needs to port forward information back to
the source.</p>

<h4 class="SECTION"><a id="QC-CONFIG-SINGLE-LOCATION-GROUPS"

<p>Quorum/Consensus provides a huge set of options for store arrangements in <b
class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> . Between backups and groups, the number of viable approaches
is practically limitless. Below are two approaches using single location groups and
multiple location groups.</p>

<p>In short, as long as one of the groups in the figure maintains quorum, then the source
can continue. See <a
href="designing-persistent-applications.html#SOURCES-USING-QC-STORE-CONFIGURATION"><i>Sources

<p>The above figure shows three groups arranged on a location basis. Each group is a
single location. Just SOME possible failure scenarios are:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Failure of any 3 stores in Group 0</p>

<p>Groups of stores can be configured across locations. Such an arrangement would ensure
continued operation in the event of a site-wide failure at any location.</p>

<h2 class="SECTION"><a id="PROXYSOURCES" name="PROXYSOURCES">10.2. Proxy Sources</a></h2>

<p>The Proxy Source capability allows you to configure stores to automatically continue
sending the source's topic advertisements which contain store information used by new
receivers. Without the store RegID, address and TCP port contained in the source's Topic
Information Records (TIR), new receivers cannot register with the store or request
retransmissions. After the source returns, the store automatically stops acting as a
proxy source.</p>

<p>Some other features of Proxy Sources include:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Requires a Quorum/Consensus store configuration.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Normal store failover operation also initiates a new proxy source.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A store can be running more than one proxy source if more than one source has
failed.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A store can be running multiple proxy sources for the same topic.</p>

<h3 class="SECTION"><a id="OPERATING-PROXYSOURCE" name="OPERATING-PROXYSOURCE">10.2.1.
How Proxy Sources Operate</a></h3>

<p>The following sequence illustrates the life of a proxy source.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>A source configured for Proxy Source sends to receivers and a group of
Quorum/Consensus stores.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The source fails.</p>

<li>
<p>The source's <a

</li>

<li>
<p>The Quorum/Consensus stores elect a single store to run the proxy source.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The elected store creates a proxy source and sends topic advertisements.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The failed source reappears.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The store deletes the proxy source and the original source resumes activity.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>If the store running the proxy source fails, the other stores in the Quorum/Consensus
group detect a source failure again and elect a new store to initiate a proxy source.</p>

<p>If a loss of quorum occurs, the proxy source can continue to send advertisements, but
cannot send messages until a quorum is re-established.</p>

Options</a></h3>

<p><b class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> provides activity and state lifetime timers for sources

This section explains how these timers work together and how they work with proxy
sources.</p>

<p>The <a href="../Config/ultramessagingpersistenceoptions.html#SOURCEUMEACTIVITYTIMEOUT"
target="doccontent"><tt class="LITERAL">ume_activity_timeout</tt></a> options determine how
long a source or receiver must be inactive before a store allows another source or

the <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> Configuration Option cited above or with a topic's <tt

<h3 class="SECTION"><a id="Q-MASTER-ELECTION-PROCESS"
name="Q-MASTER-ELECTION-PROCESS">10.3.1. Queue Master Election Process</a></h3>

<p>Queue instances use an internal election process to determine a master queue
responsible for making assignments and handling any dissemination requirements. The
master is also responsible for tracking queue instance liveness and handling queue
resolution duties. Those queue instances that are not the master (slaves) simply act as
passive observers of queue activities. Slaves may fail and come online without seriously
impacting operations. When a master fails, though, an election occurs. Once the election
process establishes a new master, queue operation can proceed.</p>

<p>A queue instance is elected master based on the three values shown below and presented
in order of importance.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>The QSI's <tt class="LITERAL">queue-management-election-bias</tt> configured in it's
<tt class="LITERAL">umestored</tt> XML configuration file.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The QSI's age computed from the number of messages received and submitted by the QSI.
<b class="APPLICATION">UMQ</b> uses the QSI age if all QSI bias values are equal.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>An internal QSI index. <b class="APPLICATION">UMQ</b> uses the QSI index if all QSI
bias and age values are equal.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><b class="APPLICATION">UMQ</b>'s default behavior assigns the same election bias to
every QSI, which often results in the "oldest", active QSI being elected the master
queue. If you wish finer control of the election process, you can configure each Queue
Instance with an election bias. You could assign the higher election bias values to the
Queue Instances you know are running on the more powerful machines or those with the
lowest latency. See <a href="umestored-config.html#QUEUE-MANAGEMENT-OPTIONS"><i>Queue
Management Options for a Queue's ume-attributes Element</i></a> for more information.</p>

<p>The following summarizes the Queue Master Election Process.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>A Queue Slave Instance (QSI) detects the loss of the master if the <tt
class="LITERAL">queue_management_master_activity_timeout</tt> expires without any
Instance Lists having been sent during the timeout period.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The QSI that detected the loss of the master names itself Queue Election Master
(QEM).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The QEM sends an Election Call to all QSIs, which also identifies itself as the new
QEM.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>All QSIs reply to the Election Call with their "instance vote" which contains their
own election bias and "age".</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The QEM selects the QSI with the highest election bias as the master. If two or more
QSIs have the highest bias, the QEM selects the "oldest" of the QSIs with the highest
bias. The QSI with the most messages received and submitted is considered the oldest. A
third tie breaker is an internal QSI index.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The QEM sends out another ILN naming the elected QSI as the Post Election Master
(PEM).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>QSIs confirm receipt of the ILN.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>QEM sends a Resume Operation message to the PEM.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The PEM resumes operation of the Queue (assigning messages to receivers, managing
dissemination requirements, tracking QSI health, handling queue resolution traffic) and
sends a Instance List Notification flagging itself as the current master.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="SECTION"><a id="QUEUE-FAILOVER" name="QUEUE-FAILOVER">10.4. Queue
Failover</a></h2>

<p>The following sections discuss various queue failover scenarios.</p>

<div class="SECTION">
<h3 class="SECTION"><a id="FAILOVERLOSSQUORUM" name="FAILOVERLOSSQUORUM">10.4.1. Failover
from Loss of Quorum</a></h3>

<p>If the loss of a QSI results in the loss of quorum, the master Queue stops advertising
(QIR). As a result, sources lose their registration and subsequent messages sent by the
sources return an LBM_EUMENOREG event. (If a source is connected to both a store and a
queue, subsequent message sends return an LBM_ENO_QUEUE_REG event.) When quorum is
regained by the recovery of the lost QSI or the addition of a new QSI, the master Queue
advertises again. Sending and receiving <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> contexts can then
resolve the Queue again and re-register.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECTION">
<h3 class="SECTION"><a id="FAILOVERLOSSMASTER" name="FAILOVERLOSSMASTER">10.4.2. Failover
from Loss of Master</a></h3>

<p>If the master Queue fails, the following two events occur.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Sources lose their registration and subsequent messages sent by the sources return an
LBM_EUMENOREG event. (If a source is connected to both a store and a queue, subsequent
message sends return an LBM_ENO_QUEUE_REG event.)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The first QSI to detect the loss of the master calls an election. See <a
href="ume-fault-tolerance.html#Q-MASTER-ELECTION-PROCESS"><i>Queue Master Election
Process</i></a>. After wards, the new master Queue starts advertising, allowing sending
and receiving <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> contexts to resolve the Queue and
re-register.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If, due to a series of failures, a QSI notices that it has stored messages that the
master queue never saw, it attempts to resubmit them to the master queue. The master
queue either accepts these when it determines that it never saw them, or it rejects the
resubmission attempt. If the master queue accepts the resubmit, it marks the message as a
resubmission when it assigns the message to a receiver, informing the receiver that it
was resubmitted from a QSI.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECTION">
<h3 class="SECTION"><a id="OTHER-SCENARIOS" name="OTHER-SCENARIOS">10.4.3. Other
Scenarios</a></h3>

<p>If a receiver fails unexpectedly, the queue does not become aware of this until <tt
class="LITERAL">receiver-activity-timeout</tt> expires. In the mean time, the queue
continues to assign messages to the receiver until the receiver's portion size is met.
When the <tt class="LITERAL">message-reassignment-timeout</tt> expires, the queue
reassigns the message to a different receiver and sets the message's reassigned flag to
inform the receiving application that the message may have been seen by a different
receiver.</p>

<p>Receivers can call <code class="FUNCTION">lbm_rcv_umq_deregister()</code> or <code
class="FUNCTION">lbm_wildcard_rcv_umq_deregister()</code> to gracefully deregister from
the queue. The queue does not assign any new messages to it.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECTION">
<h3 class="SECTION"><a id="FAILOVERLOSSQSI" name="FAILOVERLOSSQSI">10.4.4. Failover from
Loss of Slave (QSI)</a></h3>

<p>Assuming the master queue is running and assuming quorum has been maintained, QSIs
coming and going have little to no impact on queue operation. QSIs are largely passive
bystanders. As QSIs come and go from the queue, the master queue notifies the <b
class="APPLICATION">UM</b> contexts registered with the queue via instance list
notifications (ILN). These notifications inform the contexts which QSI was added or
removed.</p>
