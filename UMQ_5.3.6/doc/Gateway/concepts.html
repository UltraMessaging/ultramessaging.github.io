<h2 class="SECTION"><a id="PORTALS" name="PORTALS">2.1. UM Gateway Portals</a></h2>

<p>A UM Gateway consists of two or more bidirectional portals that may be one of two
types:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>An <b class="APPLICATION">endpoint</b> portal that communicates directly to a <b
class="APPLICATION">UM</b> topic resolution domain.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A <b class="APPLICATION">peer</b> portal that communicates only with another peer
portal (of another gateway), allowing tunneling behavior between gateways or other
portals.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You configure portals in the gateway's XML configuration file, specifying the portal's
name, cost, <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> Configuration, Access Control Lists and other
attributes. See <a href="configuration.html"><i>UM Gateway Configuration</i></a> for
more.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECTION">
<h2 class="SECTION"><a id="TR-DOMAIN" name="TR-DOMAIN">2.2. Topic Resolution
Domains</a></h2>

<p><b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> contexts must satisfy the following two requirements to
belong to the same topic resolution domain.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The contexts must use the same topic resolution <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b>
configuration (i.e., <tt class="LITERAL">resolver_*</tt> options are the same).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Contexts can communicate using the protocols required for both message transport and
topic resolution traffic.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, two contexts on separate machines in the same LAN are not in the same
topic resolution domain if they use different resolver addresses. See <a
href="../Config/multicastresolvernetworkoptions.html" target="doccontent"><tt
class="LITERAL">Multicast Resolver Network Options</tt></a>. A topic resolution domain
can span a WAN if the <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> contexts on each side of a firewall
use the same <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> configuration and the firewall allows UDP
traffic (multicast or unicast) to pass.</p>

<p>Each endpoint portal must identify its associated topic resolution domain with a <tt
class="LITERAL">domain-id</tt> in the gateway's XML configuration file, as in the example
below. All portals in the same topic resolution domain must have the same <tt
class="LITERAL">domain-id</tt>.</p>

<p>The diagram, <a href="concepts.html#TNW-GATEWAY"><i>UM Gateway</i></a>, shows a UM
Gateway bridging topic resolution domain 1 and topic resolution domain 2, for topic AAA.
Endpoint E1 contains a proxy receiver for topic AAA and endpoint E2 has a proxy source
for topic AAA.</p>

<h3 class="SECTION"><a id="TOPIC-RESOLUTION-ACROSS-GATEWAY"
name="TOPIC-RESOLUTION-ACROSS-GATEWAY">2.3.1. Topic Resolution Across the
Gateway</a></h3>

<p>To establish topic resolution in an already-running UM Gateway, the following
typically occurs in an example like the above figure.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>A receiver in topic resolution domain 2 issues a TQR for topic AAA.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Portal E2 receives the TQR and requests that portal E1 find a TIR for AAA on topic
resolution domain 1. At this point, we can say that <i class="FIRSTTERM">interest</i> for
topic AAA has been discovered within the gateway.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>E1 immediately responds with three actions: a) create a proxy receiver for topic AAA,
which b) sends a TQR for AAA on domain 1, and c) issues a Topic Interest message for the
benefit of any other portals that may exist in this gateway.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A source for topic AAA in domain 1 issues a TIR.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>E1's AAA proxy receiver requests that E2 (and any other portals in the gateway) create
a proxy source for AAA.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>E2 creates proxy source AAA and issues a TIR to domain 2, thus completing topic
resolution.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="SECTION">
<h3 class="SECTION"><a id="INTEREST-AND-USE-QUERIES"
name="INTEREST-AND-USE-QUERIES">2.3.2. Interest and Use Queries</a></h3>

<p>When a UM Gateway first starts, its endpoint portals issue a brief series of Topic
Resolution Request messages to their respective topic resolution domains. This provokes
quiescent receivers (and wildcard receivers) into sending TQRs, indicating interest in
the various topics. Each portal then records this interest. The gateway uses a periodic
purge cycle to detect when there is no longer any interest in the topic (i.e. all
receivers for a topic have been deleted), and removes it from the portals.</p>

<p>After a gateway has been running, endpoint portals issue periodic Topic Use Queries
and Pattern Use Queries (collectively referred to as simply Use Queries). Use Query
Responses from UM contexts confirm that the receivers for these topics indeed still
exist, thus maintaining these topics on the interest list. Autonomous TQRs also refresh
interest and have the effect of suppressing the generation of Use Queries.</p>

<div class="FIGURE"><a id="USE-QUERIES" name="USE-QUERIES"></a>
<p><b>Figure 2. Use Queries and Interest</b></p>

<p><img src="Use-Queries.png" align="CENTER" /></p>
</div>

<p>In the case of multi-hop gateway configurations, gateways cannot detect interest for
remote contexts via Use Queries or TQRs. They do this instead via Interest Messages. A
portal generates periodic interest messages, which are picked up by adjacent gateways
(i.e., the next hop over), at which time interest is refreshed.</p>

<div class="FIGURE"><a id="INTEREST-MESSAGES" name="INTEREST-MESSAGES"></a>
<p><b>Figure 3. Interest Messages</b></p>

<p><img src="Interest-Messages.png" align="CENTER" /></p>

<p>Intervals, limits, and durations for these topic resolution and interest mechanisms
can be adjusted via gateway configuration options (see <a href="configuration.html"><i>UM
Gateway Configuration</i></a>).</p>
</div>

<div class="SECTION">
<h3 class="SECTION"><a id="GATEWAY-KEEPALIVE" name="GATEWAY-KEEPALIVE">2.3.3. Gateway
Keepalive</a></h3>

<p>To maintain a reliable connection, gateways exchange <i class="FIRSTTERM">Gateway
Keepalive</i> signals when connected via peer portals. Keepalive intervals and connection
timeouts are configurable, and you can also set the gateway to send keepalives only when
traffic is idle (default). See <a href="tnwgd-dtd-doc/tnwgd.dtd.html#gateway-keepalive"
target="doccontent"><tt class="LITERAL">&lt;gateway-keepalive&#62;</tt></a>.</p>

<div class="SECTION">
<h3 class="SECTION"><a id="PROXY-SOURCES-AND-RECEIVERS"
name="PROXY-SOURCES-AND-RECEIVERS">2.3.4. Proxy Sources and Receivers</a></h3>

<p>The <tt class="LITERAL">domain-id</tt> is used by Interest Messages and other internal
and gateway-to-gateway traffic to ensure forwarding of all messages (payload and topic
resolution) to the correct recipients. This also has the effect of not creating proxy
sources/receivers where they are not needed. Thus, gateways create proxy sources and
receivers based solely on receiver interest.</p>

<p>If more than one source sends on a given topic, the receiving portal's single proxy
receiver for that topic receives all messages sent on that topic. The sending portal,
however creates a proxy source for every source sending on the topic. The UM Gateway
maintains a table of proxy sources, each keyed by an Originating Transport ID (OTID).
This enables proxy receiver to forward each message to the correct proxy source.</p>

<div class="NOTE">
<blockquote class="NOTE">
<p><b>Note:</b> <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> sources create a unique OTID that describes
their transport sessions and include this OTID in their topic advertisements. For more on

Multi-Hop Forwarding</a></h3>

<div class="FIGURE"><a id="GATEWAY-NET" name="GATEWAY-NET"></a>
<p><b>Figure 4. Multi-Hop Network Example</b></p>

<p><img src="Gateway_Net.png" align="CENTER" /></p>
</div>

<p>In this diagram, gateway A has two endpoint portals, connected to topic resolution
domains 1 and 2. gateway B also has two endpoint portals that bridge domains 2 and 3.
(Endpoint portal names reflect the topic resolution domain to which they connect. For
example, gateway A endpoint E2 interfaces topic resolution domain 2.)</p>

<p>Topic resolution domain 1 has a source for topic AAA, and domain 3, an AAA receiver.
The following sequence of events enables the forwarding of topic messages from source AAA
to receiver AAA.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>Receiver AAA queries (issues a TQR) for a source.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Gateway B, endpoint E3 (B-E3) receives the TQR and requests that any other portals in
the gateway forward any AAA advertisements.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In response, B-E2 creates a proxy receiver for AAA and sends a Topic Interest message
for AAA to topic resolution domain 2. (The proxy receiver also issues a TQR.)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Gateway A, endpoint E2 (A-E2) receives this Topic Interest message and requests that
any other portals in the gateway forward any AAA advertisements.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In response, A-E1 creates a proxy receiver for AAA and sends a Topic Interest message
(and TQR) for AAA to domain 1.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Source AAA responds to the TQR by sending a TIR for topic AAA.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The AAA proxy receiver created by A-E1 receives this TIR and requests that all gateway
A portals with an interest in topic AAA create a proxy source for AAA.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In response, A-E2 creates a proxy source which sends a TIR for topic AAA via domain
2.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The AAA proxy receiver created by B-E2 receives this TIR and requests that all gateway
B portals with an interest in topic AAA create a proxy source for AAA.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In response, B-E3 creates a proxy source, which sends a TIR for topic AAA via domain
3.</p>

<h2 class="SECTION"><a id="FORWARDING-COSTS" name="FORWARDING-COSTS">2.4. Forwarding
Costs</a></h2>

<p>Forwarding a message through a gateway incurs a cost in terms of latency, network
bandwidth, and CPU utilization on the gateway machine, which may in turn affect the
latency of other forwarded messages. Transiting multiple gateways adds even more
cumulative latency to a message. Other gateway-related factors such as network bandwidth,
switches, etc., can also add latency.</p>

<p>Factors other than latency contribute to the cost of forwarding a message. Consider a
message that can be sent from one domain to its destination domain over one of two paths.
A three-hop path over 1000Mbps links may be faster than a single-hop path over a 100Mbps
link. Further, it may be the case that the 100Mbps link is more expensive or less
reliable. These could all be reasons for favoring the longer path.</p>

<p>To account for these cost factors, topic advertisements (TIR) contain the following
two fields.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><tt class="LITERAL">hop count</tt></p>
</li>

<li>
<p><tt class="LITERAL">cost</tt></p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>These fields appear as topic options within the TIR. When you call <tt
class="LITERAL">lbm_src_create()</tt>, <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> sets both to 0
(zero) for use by the UM Gateway. You cannot set these fields; they are populated
automatically by the gateway(s).</p>

<p>&#13;</p>

<div class="SECTION">
<h3 class="SECTION"><a id="HOP-COUNT" name="HOP-COUNT">2.4.1. Hop Count</a></h3>

<p>When the egress portal of a gateway creates a proxy source to forward, in effect, the
original source's topic advertisement, it increments the <tt class="LITERAL">hop
count</tt> by one. In the Multi-hop example presented earlier, gateway A, endpoint E2
(A-E2) and gateway B, endpoint E3 (B-E3) would each increment the <tt class="LITERAL">hop
count</tt>, resulting in receiver AAA receiving a TIR with a <tt class="LITERAL">hop
count</tt> = 2.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECTION">
<h3 class="SECTION"><a id="PORTAL-COSTS" name="PORTAL-COSTS">2.4.2. Portal Costs</a></h3>

<p>The UM Gateway lets you assign a cost to a portal. As with the <tt class="LITERAL">hop
count</tt>, when a portal creates a proxy source, it adds the portal's configured cost to
the topic cost in the TIR. By default, the cost associated with a portal is 0. Using the
Multi-hop example again, setting portal A-E2's cost to 3 increases the topic's cost by
that much. If portal B-E3's cost is 2, the topic's <tt class="LITERAL">cost</tt> (and TIR
cost), as received by receiver AAA, is now 5. The UM Gateway uses the cost to ensure that
proxy receivers connect via the most efficient path to/from their source.</p>

<div class="NOTE">
<blockquote class="NOTE">
<p><b>Note:</b> After paths are established, if a new lower-cost source becomes
available, receivers do not switch to it.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>

<div class="SECTION">
<h3 class="SECTION"><a id="DUPLICATE-PREVENTION" name="DUPLICATE-PREVENTION">2.4.3.
Resolver Cache's Stored Cost Values Prevents Duplicates</a></h3>

<p>The <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> Resolver Cache stores TIRs to help receivers find
sources. In addition to transport session information, the stored TIR contains the OTID,
hop count and cost values. This information can be used by receivers to select the lowest
cost source if a source sends over multiple network paths.</p>

<p>In more complex network topologies, messages from the same source may traverse
multiple paths and therefore, arrive from different proxy sources and different transport
sessions. If a receiver looks up a topic in the cache and finds two TIRs with the same
OTID but different transport sessions, it chooses the OTID with the lowest cost and joins
that transport to receive messages. This prevents receiving duplicate messages from the
same source.</p>

<p>A <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b> receiver always treats advertisements for the same
topic with the same OTID as equivalent transport sessions, and joins only one of them. In
the event that the receiver detects an EOS on the joined transport session, one of any
remaining equivalent transport sessions can be joined.</p>

<p>For Multicast Immediate Messages (MIM) traffic, <b class="APPLICATION">UM</b>
receivers keep a sequence number map for every OTID they have received messages from and
reject any messages that have already been received.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECTION">
<h3 class="SECTION"><a id="APPS-SET-TOPIC-COST" name="APPS-SET-TOPIC-COST">2.4.4.
Applications Can Also Set the Topic Cost</a></h3>

<p>Your application can change the cost of a topic in the receiving application's context
using a callback ( <a
href="../Config/majoroptions.html#CONTEXTSOURCECOSTEVALUATIONFUNCTION" target="doccontent"><tt
class="LITERAL">source_cost_evaluation_function</tt></a>) that the UM Gateway uses in <tt
class="LITERAL">lbm_src_cost_function_cb()</tt>. The gateway invokes this function
whenever it receives an advertisement containing cost information. With a multiple-path
topology, the gateway always forwards advertisements and messages via the least costly
path, using <tt class="LITERAL">lbm_src_cost_function_cb()</tt> to determine the
cost.</p>

<p>You can supply a callback with <a
href="../Config/majoroptions.html#CONTEXTSOURCECOSTEVALUATIONFUNCTION" target="doccontent"><tt
class="LITERAL">source_cost_evaluation_function</tt></a> to affect this cost
determination, increasing the cost of less desirable paths or completing filtering out
certain paths. The gateway passes the topic name, hop count, and cost to the configured
callback, which returns an integral cost value the gateway assigns to the topic. If you
do not set <a href="../Config/majoroptions.html#CONTEXTSOURCECOSTEVALUATIONFUNCTION"
target="doccontent"><tt class="LITERAL">source_cost_evaluation_function</tt></a>, a default
function returns the cost as passed to it.</p>

<div class="NOTE">
<blockquote class="NOTE">
<p><b>Note:</b> Your gateway application cannot directly configure the cost in a TIR;
this is done by only the gateway itself.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="SECTION">
<h2 class="SECTION"><a id="ACL" name="ACL">2.5. Access Control Lists (ACL)</a></h2>

<p>You can apply Access Control Lists (ACL) to a gateway's portals to filter or load
balance traffic by certain topics, transports, topic patterns, multicast groups, etc. You
configure ACLs in a gateway's XML configuration file, as children of an <tt
class="LITERAL">&lt;endpoint&#62;</tt> or <tt class="LITERAL">&lt;peer&#62;</tt> portal.
As traffic arrives at the portal, the portal either forwards it or rejects it per ACL
criteria.</p>

<p>Inbound ACLs determine what information to forward to other portals in the gateway,
while Outbound ACLs determine (by topic) what information from other portals that this
portal can forward out the gateway. Each portal (endpoint or peer) can have up to one
inbound ACL and one outbound ACL.</p>

<p>An ACL can contain one or more Access Control Entries (ACEs). ACEs let you match (and
accept or reject based on), criteria elements called Access Control Conditions (ACCs).
Possible ACCs are:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><tt class="LITERAL">&lt;multicast-group/&#62;</tt> *</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><tt class="LITERAL">&lt;pcre-pattern&#62;</tt> (PCRE wildcard patterns)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><tt class="LITERAL">&lt;regex-pattern&#62;</tt> (Regex wildcard patterns)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><tt class="LITERAL">&lt;source-ip/&#62;</tt> *</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><tt class="LITERAL">&lt;tcp-source-port/&#62;</tt> *</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><tt class="LITERAL">&lt;topic&#62;</tt></p>
</li>

<li>
<p><tt class="LITERAL">&lt;transport/&#62;</tt> *</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><tt class="LITERAL">&lt;udp-destination-port/&#62;</tt> *</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><tt class="LITERAL">&lt;udp-source-port/&#62;</tt> *</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><tt class="LITERAL">&lt;xport-id/&#62;</tt> * (for LBT-IPC traffic)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>* These items apply to only inbound ACLs, and are ignored if used with an outbound
ACL.</p>

<p>The above elements are all children of the <tt class="LITERAL">&lt;ace&#62;</tt>
element. When an ACL has multiple ACE entries, the UM Gateway goes down the list until it
finds a match. It then accepts (forwards) or rejects, and is done with that ACL. An
implicit "reject all" is at the end of every ACL, so the UM Gateway rejects any topic not
matched. If you place multiple ACCs within an ACE, the gateway performs an "and"
operation with them.</p>

<p>Note that the portal ignores an ACC if a) it is inbound-only and used in an outbound
ACL, or b) it simply does not apply (such as a <tt
class="LITERAL">&lt;udp-source-port/&#62;</tt> if the transport is TCP).</p>

<p>Consider the following example, where we configure a portal to forward on specific
topics. This example also illustrates the parent/child hierarchy for ACLs, ACEs, and
ACCs.</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
    &lt;endpoint&#62;
      &lt;name&#62;LAN1&lt;/name&#62;
      &lt;lbm-config&#62;lan1.cfg&lt;/lbm-config&#62;
      &lt;domain-id&#62;1&lt;/domain-id&#62;
        &lt;acl&#62;
          &lt;inbound&#62;
            &lt;ace match="accept"&#62;
              &lt;topic&#62;ABC&lt;/topic&#62;
            &lt;/ace&#62;
            &lt;ace match="accept"&#62;
              &lt;topic&#62;DEF&lt;/topic&#62;
              &lt;transport value=lbt-rm comparison=eq/&#62;
            &lt;/ace&#62;
            &lt;ace match="accept"&#62;
              &lt;topic&#62;GHI&lt;/topic&#62;
            &lt;/ace&#62;       
          &lt;/inbound&#62;
        &lt;/acl&#62;
    &lt;/endpoint&#62;
   
</pre>

<p>The above example shows each topic match in a separate ACE. When topic "GHI" arrives,
the portal finds a match in the third ACE and forwards the topic. (Placing all three <tt
class="LITERAL">&lt;topic&#62;</tt>s in a single ACE would never match anything.) Also
note that "DEF" is forwarded only if it uses an LBT-RM transport.</p>

<p>Since the behavior for multiple ACEs is "first match, then done", list ACEs in a
specific-to-general order. For the example below, to forward topic "ABC123" but reject
similar topics such as "ABCD123" or "ABCE123", list the ACE for "ABC123" first (as done
below). If the ACE to reject "ABC.*123" was listed first, it would also (undesirably)
match and reject "ABC123".</p>

Forwarding</a></h2>

<p>For request/response, the gateway appears as the responder from the perspective of the
requester, and as the requester from the perspective of the responder. The UM Gateway
supports request/response directly by maintaining a map between the original requester
and the proxy request object it creates. The UM Gateway modifies requests and responses
to appear as if they originated from the gateway.</p>

<h2 class="SECTION"><a id="MIM-CONSIDERATIONS" name="MIM-CONSIDERATIONS">2.7. Multicast
Immediate Messaging Considerations</a></h2>

<p>Multicast Immediate Messages (MIM) flood through the UM Gateway. You cannot filter MIM
with <a href="concepts.html#ACL"><i>Access Control Lists (ACL)</i></a>. Receivers on the
other side of the gateway can easily receive duplicate messages. Informatica does not
recommend using MIM for messaging traffic across the UM Gateway. MIM is intended for
short-lived topics and applications that cannot tolerate a delay between source creation
and the sending of the first message. See also <a

<p>The UM Gateway supports wildcard receivers, provided wildcard topic querying is not
disabled. The gateway processes wildcard queries, replicating the functionality in the <b

<h2 class="SECTION"><a id="TCP-TUNNELING" name="TCP-TUNNELING">2.9. TCP Connections for
Tunneling</a></h2>

<p>A UM Gateway peer portal communicates with exactly one peer portal on another gateway.
Peer portals utilize TCP connections for all data and control traffic. (UDP is not
supported for this.) Between the peer portals, you can configure either a single TCP
connection, or dual TCP, with one connection serving each direction. The UM Gateway
supports one tunnel per peer portal pair, and multiple peer portals.</p>

<p>Below is an example of a two companion peer portals (on different gateways) configured
(via gateway XML configuration file) for dual TCP connections. The companion peer portal
(at the other end of the tunnel) would have its sockets defined inversely.</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
&lt;portals&#62;
  &lt;peer&#62;
    &lt;name&#62;TUNNEL_TO_LAN2&lt;/name&#62;
    &lt;tcp&#62;
      &lt;interface&#62;10.30.3.0/24&lt;/interface&#62;
      &lt;listen-port&#62;26123&lt;/listen-port&#62;
      &lt;companion&#62;
        &lt;address&#62;10.30.3.88&lt;/address&#62;
        &lt;port&#62;26124&lt;/port&#62;
      &lt;/companion&#62;
    &lt;/tcp&#62;
  &lt;/peer&#62;
&lt;/portals&#62;

&lt;portals&#62;
  &lt;peer&#62;
    &lt;name&#62;TUNNEL_TO_LAN1&lt;/name&#62;
    &lt;tcp&#62;

<h2 class="SECTION"><a id="RESILIENCE" name="RESILIENCE">2.10. Gateway
Resilience</a></h2>

<p>The UM Gateway supports resilience by way of parallel paths between topic resolution
domains. This technique is referred to as Replication. Each gateway forwards traffic in a
normal manner, and receivers are responsible for discarding duplicate messages. A similar
approach can be taken for peer portals, in which case two gateways are required for each
path, for a total of four gateways.</p>

<div class="CAUTION">
<blockquote class="CAUTION">
<p><b>Important:</b> Although it is possible to configure multiple paths between topic
resolution domains, configurations that result in loops or meshes are not supported.

<div class="SECTION">
<h3 class="SECTION"><a id="CONSEQUENCES" name="CONSEQUENCES">2.10.1. Resilience
Considerations</a></h3>

<p>You should consider the following issues when developing your approach to gateway
resilience.</p>

<div class="SECTION">
<h4 class="SECTION"><a id="TRAFFIC" name="TRAFFIC">2.10.1.1. Traffic Volume</a></h4>

<p>Any time there exists more than one path a message can take from one point to another,
the possibility exists that the message will take more than one path. Due to duplicate
detection, an individual receiver will only receive each message once. However, depending
on the type of transport, the message may still appear on the network multiple times.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECTION">
<h4 class="SECTION"><a id="DATA-SESSION" name="DATA-SESSION">2.10.1.2. Data Session
Re-establishment</a></h4>

<p>When multiple paths exist from a source to a receiver, multiple proxy sources may be
created adjacent to the receiver domain, appearing to the receiver as distinct but
equivalent sources for the same topic. Topic resolution establishes a receiver for one
such source. If one of the gateways fails, upon an EOS for the affected transport
sessions, the receiver joins an equivalent transport session and continues to receive
data from the remaining proxy sources, subject to EOS timeouts.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECTION">
<h4 class="SECTION"><a id="UNICAST-CONTROL-SESSION"
name="UNICAST-CONTROL-SESSION">2.10.1.3. Unicast Control Session
Re-establishment</a></h4>

<p>While a receiver can participate in multiple channels for the same topic, this is not
possible with unicast control sessions. For example, even if two adjacent gateways both
proxy the same store via different paths, a receiver can only connect to one proxy at a
time. This means that, regardless of whether you chose replication or redundancy, the
loss of one adjacent gateway may cause a brief pause while unicast control sessions
re-establish.</p>
</div>
</div>
