Fixes</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In the UM Gateway, log messages that appear upon restart indicating a <tt
class="LITERAL">forwarding entry</tt> or <tt class="LITERAL">ctxinst</tt> have been
changed from WARNING to INFORMATIONAL. These log messages are normal and do not appear as
the gateway discovers the surrounding environment and sets up the required forwarding
information.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Resolved a known issue with the UM Gateway that was reported in <b
class="APPLICATION">LBM</b> 4.2.1 <a
href="seclbm4.2.1-ume3.2.1-umq2.1.1.html#LBM4.2.1-KNOWNISSUES"><i>Known Issues</i></a>.
Previously if you brought down a UM Gateway, reconfigured its number and/or type of
portals and then restarted it, you had to also restart any other gateways with which that
reconfigured gateway either connected to previously or currently connects to. Now you do
not have to restart any connecting gateways.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Fixed a problem with the <a href="../JavaAPI/html/index.html" target="doccontent">Java
API</a> that could cause a crash of the JVM if a user's source event callback threw an
uncaught exception.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Corrected a problem that prevented LBM 4.0 receivers from joining multiple pre-LBM 4.0
sources sending on the same topic if the topic advertisements for those sources were sent
before the receivers were created.</p>
</li>
</ul>

Known Issues</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p>When using Event Queues with the Java API on Mac OS X kernel 9.4, core dumps have
occurred. Mac OS X kernel versions prior to 9.4 have not produced this behavior.
Informatica is investigating this issue.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>When using LBT-IPC, a seg fault can occur when sending messages larger than 65,535
bytes when <a href="../Config/majoroptions.html#RECEIVERORDEREDDELIVERY"
target="doccontent"><tt class="LITERAL">ordered_delivery</tt></a> has been set to 0 (zero). The
seg fault occurs when fragments are lost. Setting <a
href="../Config/transportlbt-ipcoperationoptions.html#SOURCETRANSPORTLBTIPCBEHAVIOR"
target="doccontent"><tt class="LITERAL">transport_lbtipc_behavior</tt></a> to <tt
class="LITERAL">receiver_paced</tt> avoids the seg fault by eliminating loss. Informatica
is investigating this issue.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>When using the LBT-RDMA transport with Java applications, a segfault can occur if you
kill a receiver with <b class="KEYCAP">Ctrl</b>-<b class="KEYCAP">C</b>. As a workaround,
use the JVM option, <tt class="LITERAL">-Xrs</tt>. Informatica is investigating this
problem.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If you use the current version of VMS (3.2.8), <b class="APPLICATION">LBM</b> 4.1
issues the following warning: <tt class="LITERAL">LOG Level 5: LBT-RDMA: VMS Logger
Message (Error): vmss_create_store: 196[E] vms_listen: rdma_bind_addr failed (r=-1)</tt>.
This warning indicates that <tt class="LITERAL">rdma_bind</tt> failed for ethernet
interfaces, which is expected behavior. Currently, VMS attempts <tt
class="LITERAL">rdma_bind</tt> on all interfaces. When released, VMS version 3.2.9 will
only run <tt class="LITERAL">rdma_bind</tt> on infiniband-capable interfaces.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>When using <a href="../Config/automaticmonitoringoptions.html" target="doccontent"><tt
class="LITERAL">Automatic Monitoring</tt></a> with <a
href="../Config/transportaccelerationoptions.html#CONTEXTUDACCELERATION"
target="doccontent"><tt class="LITERAL">ud_acceleration</tt></a> and the epoll file descriptor
option, <b class="APPLICATION">LBM</b> may leave a monitoring thread running after
context deletion. This situation produces the following error: <tt class="LITERAL">VMA
ERROR : epoll_wait_call:36:epoll_wait_call() epfd 48 not found</tt>. Informatica is
investigating this problem.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A requesting application using a UM Gateway may not receive the expected number of
responses. The problem occurs if the responses exceed the maximum datagram size, are
fragmented and the gateway must forward simultaneous fragmented responses. In this case
the fragments may become intermingled and result in a response not being delivered as
expected. The requesting application receives a warning similar to: <tt
class="LITERAL">WARNING: failed assertion [offset==0] at line 1627 in
../../../../src/lib/lbm/lbmqr.c</tt>. Informatica is investigating this problem.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>At the present time, 32-bit applications cannot interact with 64-bt applications using
the LBT-IPC transport. As a result, a 64-bit UM Gateway cannot interact with a 32-bit
application using LBT-IPC. It can only interact with a 64-bit application. Likewise, a
32-bit UM Gateway can only interact with a 32-bit application.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The UM Gateway does not currently support queuing at this time, only streaming and
persistence. This will be resolved in a future release.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The UM Gateway is not supported as a standalone Windows service at this time. This
will be resolved in a future release.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>When using the UM Gateway in a four gateway "full-mesh" configuration (i.e., all
gateways connected) the following instabilities have been observed.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Requesting applications can receive multiple or unending responses.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Restarting a single gateway has resulted in the crash of other gateways.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Running the same set of tests simultaneously in 2 opposite directions over a set of
gateways causes fatal asserts in the UM Gateways. Although this is not a typical user
configuration, more complex gateway configurations could simulate this effect. The UM
Gateway is designed to successfully forward the same set of topic messages sent both ways
across a set of gateways.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>These behaviors have not been seen in other, more typical gateway configurations.
Informatica is investigating this problem.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Under certain extreme conditions manufactured by configuring atypically low timeout
settings, the UM Gateway has been observed to terminate with various fatal assertions. We
believe this to be the result of a race condition exploited by the unusually low timer
settings. This issue has not been seen with less aggressive or default timer settings.
Informatica continues to investigate this problem.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In some cases, a UM Gateway instance does not establish a reliable peer connection
with another UM Gateway instance residing on the same Solaris 64-bit host. At this time,
Informatica does not recommend configuring 1 or more peer-connected gateway instances on
a single Solaris 64-bit host. Informatica continues to investigate this problem.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If using LBT-RDMA across the UM Gateway and you exit the gateway with <b
class="KEYCAP">Ctrl</b>-<b class="KEYCAP">C</b>, you may see a segfault. Informatica is
aware of this and has not observed any ill effects from this segfault.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>When using the UM Gateway in a failover configuration using LBT-RDMA, if the gateways
experience multiple failures, receivers may experience deafness (unable to discovers
sources). For this to occur, all gateways must fail once and at least one gateway must
fail more than once.</p>

Known Issues</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Receivers using event queues and Spectrum with <b class="APPLICATION">UME</b> can
experience a SIGSEGV while shutting down if events still exist on the event queue when it
is deleted. As a workaround, use LBM_EVQ_BLOCK when dispatching event queues. During
application shutdown, call <tt class="LITERAL">lbm_evq_unblock()</tt> after deleting
receivers associated with the event queue, but before deleting any context objects. Once
the dispatch thread exits, it is safe to proceed with context deletion. 29West is working
on a solution to this problem.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>When running a store on a Solaris machine, you may experience registration failures
after a few minutes. The store repeatedly reports the error, <tt
class="LITERAL">[WARNING]: wait returned error 4 [select: (22) Invalid argument]</tt>.
Changing <a href="../Config/majoroptions.html#CONTEXTFDMANAGEMENTTYPE" target="doccontent"><tt
class="LITERAL">fd_management_type</tt></a> to <tt class="LITERAL">devpoll</tt> prevents
this problem. Informatica is investigating this problem.</p>

<p>Fixed a problem that occurred when using either the <a
href="../JavaAPI/html/index.html" target="doccontent">Java API</a> or the <a
href="../DotNetAPI/doc/Index.html" target="doccontent">.NET API</a> and a source that sends
using a per-send client object. The problem resulted in a crash or null pointer exception
if the source was configured with both ULB and UME settings. If configured with only ULB
settings, a memory leak of the per-send client object occurred. The following shows how
you might send messages using <tt class="LITERAL">LBMContext.send()</tt> in Java or .NET
with a per-send client object.</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
LBMSourceSendExInfo exinfo = new LBMSourceSendExInfo();
exinfo.setClientObject(something);
context.send( ...., exinfo);
