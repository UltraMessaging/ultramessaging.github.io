<h3 class="SECTION"><a id="LBM4.2.1-FIXES" name="LBM4.2.1-FIXES">26.1.3. Bug
Fixes</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Corrected numerous problems with the stability and reliability of the UM Gateway.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In the UM Gateway, fixed a small memory leak that occurred when a requester processed
large fragmented responses.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In the UM Gateway, fixed an issue that could in specific circumstances cause a
receiver downstream of a restarted gateway to become deaf to some remote sources.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Corrected a problem with the UM Gateway that occurred when a gateway rejected a topic
and then accepted it. This produced the assertion, <tt class="LITERAL">[warning] WARNING:
failed assertion [topic-&#62;known_srcs==0] at line 2597 in
../../../../src/lib/lbm/lbmresolve.c</tt>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Resolved an issue that caused errors in Java during source event callbacks to corrupt
TCP streams.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="SECTION"><a id="LBM4.2.1-KNOWNISSUES" name="LBM4.2.1-KNOWNISSUES">26.1.4.
Known Issues</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p>When using Event Queues with the Java API on Mac OS X kernel 9.4, core dumps have
occurred. Mac OS X kernel versions prior to 9.4 have not produced this behavior.
Informatica is investigating this issue.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>When using LBT-IPC, a seg fault can occur when sending messages larger than 65,535
bytes when <a href="../Config/majoroptions.html#RECEIVERORDEREDDELIVERY"
target="doccontent"><tt class="LITERAL">ordered_delivery</tt></a> has been set to 0 (zero). The
seg fault occurs when fragments are lost. Setting <a
href="../Config/transportlbt-ipcoperationoptions.html#SOURCETRANSPORTLBTIPCBEHAVIOR"
target="doccontent"><tt class="LITERAL">transport_lbtipc_behavior</tt></a> to <tt
class="LITERAL">receiver_paced</tt> avoids the seg fault by eliminating loss. Informatica
is investigating this issue.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>When using the LBT-RDMA transport with Java applications, a segfault can occur if you
kill a receiver with <b class="KEYCAP">Ctrl</b>-<b class="KEYCAP">C</b>. As a workaround,
use the JVM option, <tt class="LITERAL">-Xrs</tt>. Informatica is investigating this
problem.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If you use the current version of VMS (3.2.8), <b class="APPLICATION">LBM</b> 4.1
issues the following warning: <tt class="LITERAL">LOG Level 5: LBT-RDMA: VMS Logger
Message (Error): vmss_create_store: 196[E] vms_listen: rdma_bind_addr failed (r=-1)</tt>.
This warning indicates that <tt class="LITERAL">rdma_bind</tt> failed for ethernet
interfaces, which is expected behavior. Currently, VMS attempts <tt
class="LITERAL">rdma_bind</tt> on all interfaces. When released, VMS version 3.2.9 will
only run <tt class="LITERAL">rdma_bind</tt> on infiniband-capable interfaces.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>When using <a href="../Config/automaticmonitoringoptions.html" target="doccontent"><tt
class="LITERAL">Automatic Monitoring</tt></a> with <a
href="../Config/transportaccelerationoptions.html#CONTEXTUDACCELERATION"
target="doccontent"><tt class="LITERAL">ud_acceleration</tt></a> and the epoll file descriptor
option, <b class="APPLICATION">LBM</b> may leave a monitoring thread running after
context deletion. This situation produces the following error: <tt class="LITERAL">VMA
ERROR : epoll_wait_call:36:epoll_wait_call() epfd 48 not found</tt>. Informatica is
investigating this problem.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A requesting application using a UM Gateway may not receive the expected number of
responses. The problem occurs if the responses exceed the maximum datagram size, are
fragmented and the gateway must forward simultaneous fragmented responses. In this case
the fragments may become intermingled and result in a response not being delivered as
expected. The requesting application receives a warning similar to: <tt
class="LITERAL">WARNING: failed assertion [offset==0] at line 1627 in
../../../../src/lib/lbm/lbmqr.c</tt>. Informatica is investigating this problem.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>At the present time, 32-bit applications cannot interact with 64-bt applications using
the LBT-IPC transport. As a result, a 64-bit UM Gateway cannot interact with a 32-bit
application using LBT-IPC. It can only interact with a 64-bit application. Likewise, a
32-bit UM Gateway can only interact with a 32-bit application.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The UM Gateway does not currently support queuing at this time, only streaming and
persistence. This will be resolved in a future release.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The UM Gateway is not supported as a standalone Windows service at this time. This
will be resolved in a future release.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>When using the UM Gateway in a four gateway "full-mesh" configuration (i.e., all
gateways connected) the following instabilities have been observed.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Requesting applications can receive multiple or unending responses.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Restarting a single gateway has resulted in the crash of other gateways.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Running the same set of tests simultaneously in 2 opposite directions over a set of
gateways causes fatal asserts in the UM Gateways. Although this is not a typical user
configuration, more complex gateway configurations could simulate this effect. The UM
Gateway is designed to successfully forward the same set of topic messages sent both ways
across a set of gateways.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>These behaviors have not been seen in other, more typical gateway configurations.
Informatica is investigating this problem.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Under certain extreme conditions manufactured by configuring atypically low timeout
settings, the UM Gateway has been observed to terminate with various fatal assertions. We
believe this to be the result of a race condition exploited by the unusually low timer
settings. This issue has not been seen with less aggressive or default timer settings.
Informatica continues to investigate this problem.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In some cases, a UM Gateway instance does not establish a reliable peer connection
with another UM Gateway instance residing on the same Solaris 64-bit host. At this time,
Informatica does not recommend configuring 1 or more peer-connected gateway instances on
a single Solaris 64-bit host. Informatica continues to investigate this problem.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If using LBT-RDMA across the UM Gateway and you exit the gateway with <b
class="KEYCAP">Ctrl</b>-<b class="KEYCAP">C</b>, you may see a segfault. Informatica is
aware of this and has not observed any ill effects from this segfault.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If you bring down a UM Gateway, reconfigure its number and/or type of portals and then
restart the gateway, you must also restart any other gateways with which that
reconfigured gateway either connected to previously or now connects to. Informatica is
investigating this issue.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>When using the UM Gateway in a failover configuration using LBT-RDMA, if the gateways
experience multiple failures, receivers may experience deafness (unable to discovers
sources). For this to occur, all gateways must fail once and at least one gateway must
fail more than once.</p>

Fixes</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue where a UME source reached a state where it could not successfully
register with UME stores located on the far side of one or more gateways. This situation
only occurred if there were multiple paths from the source to the stores, the paths
involved one or more peer links, and the gateways were brought down and up in rapid
succession.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Fixed an issue where messages could be prematurely reclaimed if reclamation is forced
after losing registration.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Fixed a condition that could cause a UME store to become effectively deaf to new data
after a gateway failover and restart.</p>
</li>
</ul>

Known Issues</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Receivers using event queues and Spectrum with <b class="APPLICATION">UME</b> can
experience a SIGSEGV while shutting down if events still exist on the event queue when it
is deleted. As a workaround, use LBM_EVQ_BLOCK when dispatching event queues. During
application shutdown, call <tt class="LITERAL">lbm_evq_unblock()</tt> after deleting
receivers associated with the event queue, but before deleting any context objects. Once
the dispatch thread exits, it is safe to proceed with context deletion. 29West is working
on a solution to this problem.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>When running a store on a Solaris machine, you may experience registration failures
after a few minutes. The store repeatedly reports the error, <tt
class="LITERAL">[WARNING]: wait returned error 4 [select: (22) Invalid argument]</tt>.
Changing <a href="../Config/majoroptions.html#CONTEXTFDMANAGEMENTTYPE" target="doccontent"><tt
class="LITERAL">fd_management_type</tt></a> to <tt class="LITERAL">devpoll</tt> prevents
this problem. Informatica is investigating this problem.</p>

</li>

<li>
