Fixes</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Corrected a problem that caused a fatal assert if a receiving application receives
messages from a sending application that repeatedly creates and deletes sources on the
same topic. This problem originated in the <span class="TRADEMARK">Microsoft</span>&reg;
<span class="TRADEMARK">Windows</span>&reg; release of LBM 4.2.2. Previous versions did
not have this problem.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>When using Multi-Transport Threads, a deadlock was possible if you deleted a receiver
at the same moment a transport session began or ended. An alternative locking mechanism
has been implemented to prevent a deadlock when you create new transport sessions or
delete old transport sessions using the same transport thread as a deleted receiver.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="SECTION"><a id="LBM4.2.3-KNOWNISSUES" name="LBM4.2.3-KNOWNISSUES">24.1.2.
Known Issues</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p>When using Event Queues with the Java API on Mac OS X kernel 9.4, core dumps have
occurred. Mac OS X kernel versions prior to 9.4 have not produced this behavior.
Informatica is investigating this issue.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>When using LBT-IPC, a seg fault can occur when sending messages larger than 65,535
bytes when <a href="../Config/majoroptions.html#RECEIVERORDEREDDELIVERY"
target="doccontent"><tt class="LITERAL">ordered_delivery</tt></a> has been set to 0 (zero). The
seg fault occurs when fragments are lost. Setting <a
href="../Config/transportlbt-ipcoperationoptions.html#SOURCETRANSPORTLBTIPCBEHAVIOR"
target="doccontent"><tt class="LITERAL">transport_lbtipc_behavior</tt></a> to <tt
class="LITERAL">receiver_paced</tt> avoids the seg fault by eliminating loss. Informatica
is investigating this issue.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>When using the LBT-RDMA transport with Java applications, a segfault can occur if you
kill a receiver with <b class="KEYCAP">Ctrl</b>-<b class="KEYCAP">C</b>. As a workaround,
use the JVM option, <tt class="LITERAL">-Xrs</tt>. Informatica is investigating this
problem.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If you use the current version of VMS (3.2.8), <b class="APPLICATION">UMS</b> 4.1
issues the following warning: <tt class="LITERAL">LOG Level 5: LBT-RDMA: VMS Logger
Message (Error): vmss_create_store: 196[E] vms_listen: rdma_bind_addr failed (r=-1)</tt>.
This warning indicates that <tt class="LITERAL">rdma_bind</tt> failed for ethernet
interfaces, which is expected behavior. Currently, VMS attempts <tt
class="LITERAL">rdma_bind</tt> on all interfaces. When released, VMS version 3.2.9 will
only run <tt class="LITERAL">rdma_bind</tt> on infiniband-capable interfaces.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>When using <a href="../Config/automaticmonitoringoptions.html" target="doccontent"><tt
class="LITERAL">Automatic Monitoring</tt></a> with <a
href="../Config/transportaccelerationoptions.html#CONTEXTUDACCELERATION"
target="doccontent"><tt class="LITERAL">ud_acceleration</tt></a> and the epoll file descriptor
option, <b class="APPLICATION">UMS</b> may leave a monitoring thread running after
context deletion. This situation produces the following error: <tt class="LITERAL">VMA
ERROR : epoll_wait_call:36:epoll_wait_call() epfd 48 not found</tt>. Informatica is
investigating this problem.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A requesting application using a UM Gateway may not receive the expected number of
responses. The problem occurs if the responses exceed the maximum datagram size, are
fragmented and the gateway must forward simultaneous fragmented responses. In this case
the fragments may become intermingled and result in a response not being delivered as
expected. The requesting application receives a warning similar to: <tt
class="LITERAL">WARNING: failed assertion [offset==0] at line 1627 in
../../../../src/lib/lbm/lbmqr.c</tt>. Informatica is investigating this problem.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>At the present time, 32-bit applications cannot interact with 64-bt applications using
the LBT-IPC transport. As a result, a 64-bit UM Gateway cannot interact with a 32-bit
application using LBT-IPC. It can only interact with a 64-bit application. Likewise, a
32-bit UM Gateway can only interact with a 32-bit application.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The UM Gateway does not currently support queuing at this time, only streaming and
persistence. This will be resolved in a future release.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The UM Gateway is not supported as a standalone Windows service at this time. This
will be resolved in a future release.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>When using the UM Gateway in a four gateway "full-mesh" configuration (i.e., all
gateways connected) the following instabilities have been observed.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Requesting applications can receive multiple or unending responses.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Restarting a single gateway has resulted in the crash of other gateways.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Running the same set of tests simultaneously in 2 opposite directions over a set of
gateways causes fatal asserts in the UM Gateways. Although this is not a typical user
configuration, more complex gateway configurations could simulate this effect. The UM
Gateway is designed to successfully forward the same set of topic messages sent both ways
across a set of gateways.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>These behaviors have not been seen in other, more typical gateway configurations.
Informatica is investigating this problem.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Under certain extreme conditions manufactured by configuring atypically low timeout
settings, the UM Gateway has been observed to terminate with various fatal assertions. We
believe this to be the result of a race condition exploited by the unusually low timer
settings. This issue has not been seen with less aggressive or default timer settings.
Informatica continues to investigate this problem.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In some cases, a UM Gateway instance does not establish a reliable peer connection
with another UM Gateway instance residing on the same Solaris 64-bit host. At this time,
Informatica does not recommend configuring 1 or more peer-connected gateway instances on
a single Solaris 64-bit host. Informatica continues to investigate this problem.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If using LBT-RDMA across the UM Gateway and you exit the gateway with <b
class="KEYCAP">Ctrl</b>-<b class="KEYCAP">C</b>, you may see a segfault. Informatica is
aware of this and has not observed any ill effects from this segfault.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>When using the UM Gateway in a failover configuration using LBT-RDMA, if the gateways
experience multiple failures, receivers may experience deafness (unable to discovers
sources). For this to occur, all gateways must fail once and at least one gateway must
fail more than once.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>When using the UM Gateway Informatica recommends that you <b class="APPLICATION">do
not</b> enable the Multi-Transport Threads feature. Informatica does not support nor test
the operation of Multi-Transport Threads across the UM Gateway.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Informatica has discovered that simultaneous event processing that involves EOS's and
topic advertisements (TIR) combined with receiver deletes can cause an application to
crash when using Multi-Transport Threads. Applications which routinely create and destroy
receivers as part of normal running should disable Multi-Transport Threads to avoid this
risk. Informatica is working on a solution.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Fixed a problem with source failover to proxy sources that resulted in the following
warning: <tt class="LITERAL">NOTICE: store [ip:port] reports it has not received TIR.
Possible misconfiguration?</tt></p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Fixed a problem that allowed <b class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> proxy source election
notifications to loop forever through UM Gateways configured in a loop.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Fixed a problem that could cause a deadlock when message acknowledgements were sent at
the same time that a transport session was closed.</p>

Known Issues</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Receivers using event queues and Spectrum with <b class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> can
experience a SIGSEGV while shutting down if events still exist on the event queue when it
is deleted. As a workaround, use LBM_EVQ_BLOCK when dispatching event queues. During
application shutdown, call <tt class="LITERAL">lbm_evq_unblock()</tt> after deleting
receivers associated with the event queue, but before deleting any context objects. Once
the dispatch thread exits, it is safe to proceed with context deletion. 29West is working
on a solution to this problem.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>When running a store on a Solaris machine, you may experience registration failures
after a few minutes. The store repeatedly reports the error, <tt
class="LITERAL">[WARNING]: wait returned error 4 [select: (22) Invalid argument]</tt>.
Changing <a href="../Config/majoroptions.html#CONTEXTFDMANAGEMENTTYPE" target="doccontent"><tt
class="LITERAL">fd_management_type</tt></a> to <tt class="LITERAL">devpoll</tt> prevents
this problem. Informatica is investigating this problem.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><b class="APPLICATION">UMP</b> proxy source elections can only occur among stores in
the same topic resolution domain connected directly via peer links. Informatica is
investigating this problem.</p>
