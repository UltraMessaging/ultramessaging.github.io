<h3 class="SECTION"><a id="LBM4.2-NEW" name="LBM4.2-NEW">27.1.1. New Features</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Added new receiver scope configuration option, <a
href="../Config/majoroptions.html#RECEIVERTRANSPORTDEMUXTABLESZ" target="doccontent"><tt
class="LITERAL">transport_demux_tablesz</tt></a> that sets the size of the table used for
mapping topic indices to delivery controllers.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Added new configuration option, <a
href="../Config/majoroptions.html#CONTEXTNETWORKCOMPATIBILITYMODE" target="doccontent"><tt
class="LITERAL">network_compatibility_mode</tt></a> to restrict the types of message
headers that can be sent onto the network, for the purpose of improved backward
compatibility.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Added new configuration option, <a
href="../Config/latejoinoptions.html#RECEIVERRETRANSMITINITIALSEQUENCENUMBERREQUEST"
target="doccontent"><tt class="LITERAL">retransmit_initial_sequence_number_request</tt></a>
that allows topic advertisements (TIR) to trigger a late join if receivers detect a gap
in messages instead of waiting for either a subsequent message or a TSNI.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Added <code class="FUNCTION">lbm_send_request_ex()</code> call to the <b
class="APPLICATION">LBM</b> C API (with corresponding <tt
class="LITERAL">LBMSource.send()</tt> methods in the Java and .NET APIs) to allow sending
requests with <tt class="LITERAL">lbm_src_send_ex_info_t</tt> or <tt
class="LITERAL">LBMSourceSendExInfo</tt> objects and per-send client objects.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Added a new environment variable, LBM_DEBUG_MAXSIZE, that allows the LBM DEBUG log to
roll over when the DEBUG log exceeds the maximum size specified by this variable (in
bytes). The log rolls over slightly before reaching the limit, because adding the current
log message to the log would exceed the maximum set with the environment variable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="SECTION">
<h3 class="SECTION"><a id="LBM4.2-UPDATES" name="LBM4.2-UPDATES">27.1.2. Updated
Features</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Added the Hot Failover Concentrator (HFX) feature that allows Hot Failover streams on
multiple contexts to be treated as a single hot failover stream. See <a
href="../Design/lbm-features.html#HFX" target="doccontent">Hot Failover Across Multiple
Contexts</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>TSNIs (transport topic sequence number information) have been enabled by default on
TCP transports. See also <a
href="../Config/majoroptions.html#SOURCETRANSPORTTOPICSEQUENCENUMBERINFOINTERVAL"
target="doccontent"><tt
class="LITERAL">transport_topic_sequence_number_info_interval</tt></a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Modified internal timer handling to be more judicious when waking up the context
thread to schedule a timer.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Added command line delay option in seconds (<tt class="LITERAL">-d, --delay=NUM</tt>)
for C, Java and .NET sample applications that send messages.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Implemented batching in communication between UM Gateway peer portals to improve
throughput.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The UM Gateway now allows empty (zero-length) topics and wildcard topic patterns.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Context topic advertisements may now be disabled by setting, <a
href="../Config/majoroptions.html#CONTEXTRESOLVERCONTEXTADVERTISEMENTINTERVAL"
target="doccontent"><tt class="LITERAL">resolver_context_advertisement_interval</tt></a> to 0
(zero). <b class="APPLICATION">Note:</b> Disabling context advertisements is not
recommended unless specifically advised to do so.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Zero Object Delivery (ZOD) is now enabled by default for both Java and .NET.
Applications wishing to take advantage of ZOD should call <code
class="FUNCTION">Dispose()</code> on messages before the end of the message callback.</p>

<p><b class="APPLICATION">Addendum:</b> To clarify, please note that ZOD is now an
always-on feature whenever you call <code class="FUNCTION">Dispose()</code>. If you do
not call <code class="FUNCTION">Dispose()</code>, you must call <code
class="FUNCTION">Promote()</code> to promote the message to an object. Conversely, if you
do not call <code class="FUNCTION">Promote()</code>, you must call <code
class="FUNCTION">Dispose()</code>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Added the new configuration option <a
href="../Config/deliverycontroloptions.html#CONTEXTMIMDELIVERYCONTROLLOSSCHECKINTERVAL"
target="doccontent"><tt class="LITERAL">mim_delivery_control_loss_check_interval</tt></a> to
periodically check Multicast Immediate Messaging (MIM) delivery controllers for loss.
Option defaults to 0 and follows the same basic semantics as <a
href="../Config/deliverycontroloptions.html#RECEIVERDELIVERYCONTROLLOSSCHECKINTERVAL"
target="doccontent"><tt class="LITERAL">delivery_control_loss_check_interval</tt></a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Application linking with the SmartHeap memory manager is no longer permitted under any
provision of an <b class="APPLICATION">LBM</b> license alone. Existing Informatica
applications that use the SmartHeap allocator, such as the <b class="APPLICATION">UME</b>
store daemon (<tt class="LITERAL">umestored</tt>) and the <b
class="APPLICATION">UMCache</b> daemon (<tt class="LITERAL">umcached</tt>) will continue
to use the SmartHeap allocator.</p>

<div class="SECTION">
<h3 class="SECTION"><a id="LBM4.2-FIXES" name="LBM4.2-FIXES">27.1.3. Bug Fixes</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Added an <code class="FUNCTION">isClosed()</code> function to <tt
class="LITERAL">LBMSource.cs</tt> and <tt class="LITERAL">LBMSource.java</tt> to check if
a source object has a valid C reference.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Fixed a Fatal Assert caused by a race condition that could occur when deleting an
LBT-RDMA receiver at the same moment a source disconnect event was being processed.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Corrected a problem with LBT-RU and LBT-RDMA that caused receivers to bind to the
wrong source address. These transports now check the IN_ADDRANY value before overwriting
the source IP address.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Corrected a problem when running a context in sequential mode that prevented the
transport threads from creating the event processing thread. Transport threads now force
embedded mode.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Fixed a problem that prevented non-blocking sends from returning EWOULDBLOCK when
either the rate limiter was met or the inflight messages met the flight size.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Corrected a UM Gateway issue that caused the fatal assertion, <tt
class="LITERAL">FATAL: failed assertion [wt-&#62;topic!=NULL] at line 4444 in
../../../../src/gateway/tnwgendpoint.c</tt>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Fixed a problem on Solaris i386 that caused TCP sends to always be blocking sends.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Corrected misspellings on the UM Gateway peer portal Web Monitor page.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Corrected several UM Gateway Web Monitor statistics that were being updated
incorrectly, resulting in values which were too large. The statistics involved are:</p>

<p>On the main page:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Unknown transport fragment bytes received</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Endpoint sending:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Transport topic bytes dropped due to no source</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Duplicate transport topic bytes dropped</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Endpoint receiving:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Transport topic bytes received from an unknown source</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Transport topic request bytes received with no forwarding info</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Immediate topic bytes received for an an unknown topic</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Immediate topic bytes received</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Transport topic bytes received</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Immediate topicless bytes received</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Unicast data bytes received</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p>Fixed a seg fault that could occur when canceling a recurring timer from within the
callback of that recurring timer.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Added the ability to forward (flood) Multicast Immediate Messaging (MIM) traffic from
a UM Gateway portal. You enable this feature by configuring the portal with the <tt
class="LITERAL">&lt;flood-mim/&#62;</tt> element in the UM Gateway configuration
file.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Fixed a problem in the UM Gateway that prevented topic Multicast Immediate Messaging
(MIM) messages for which no receiver exists at the endpoint portal from updating the
endpoint's MIM statistics. The endpoint now accurately reports the number of topic MIM
messages that have been dropped due to no receiver for the topic.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Corrected a problem with the Multi-Transport Threads feature that consisted of the
control block managing the thread pool per context never being freed. It is now freed
upon context deletion.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Corrected two small memory leaks in the UM Gateway.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Corrected a problem with Multicast Immediate Messaging (MIM) that resulted in the
callback specified by <a
href="../Config/multicastimmediatemessagingoperationoptions.html#CONTEXTIMMEDIATEMESSAGERECEIVERFUNCTION"
 target="doccontent"><tt class="LITERAL">immediate_message_receiver_function</tt></a> not to be
called if a wildcard receiver existed in the context.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Removed the statistics, <tt class="LITERAL">Transport topic loss/loss burst events
received</tt> and <tt class="LITERAL">Immediate loss events received</tt> from the UM
Gateway Web Monitor for Endpoint Portals. Since the UM Gateway uses arrival order
delivery, no loss events are ever delivered, so these statistics would always be
zero.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>An issue was corrected in the UM Gateway which could lead to the non-fatal assert, <tt
class="LITERAL">WARNING: failed assertion [result!=0] at line 416
in../../../../src/lib/lbm/lbmrxsctlr.c</tt>. This could also lead to another fatal
assert, <tt class="LITERAL">FATAL: failed assertion [info-&#62;sqn==ctlr-&#62;trail_sqn]
at line 249 in../../../../src/lib/lbm/lbmrxsctlr.c</tt></p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Fixed a problem that could cause some of multiple threads calling <code
class="FUNCTION">lbm_send_response()</code> to hang indefinitely.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Corrected numerous problems with the stability and reliability of the UM Gateway.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Fixed a problem that could sometimes cause <code
class="FUNCTION">lbm_context_topic_resolution_request()</code> to incorrectly return
failure when it had actually succeeded.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="SECTION">
<h3 class="SECTION"><a id="LBM4.2-KNOWNISSUES" name="LBM4.2-KNOWNISSUES">27.1.4. Known
Issues</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p>When using Event Queues with the Java API on Mac OS X kernel 9.4, core dumps have
occurred. Mac OS X kernel versions prior to 9.4 have not produced this behavior.
Informatica is investigating this issue.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>When using LBT-IPC, a seg fault can occur when sending messages larger than 65,535
bytes when <a href="../Config/majoroptions.html#RECEIVERORDEREDDELIVERY"
target="doccontent"><tt class="LITERAL">ordered_delivery</tt></a> has been set to 0 (zero). The
seg fault occurs when fragments are lost. Setting <a
href="../Config/transportlbt-ipcoperationoptions.html#SOURCETRANSPORTLBTIPCBEHAVIOR"
target="doccontent"><tt class="LITERAL">transport_lbtipc_behavior</tt></a> to <tt
class="LITERAL">receiver_paced</tt> avoids the seg fault by eliminating loss. Informatica
is investigating this issue.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>When using the LBT-RDMA transport with Java applications, a segfault can occur if you
kill a receiver with <b class="KEYCAP">Ctrl</b>-<b class="KEYCAP">C</b>. As a workaround,
use the JVM option, <tt class="LITERAL">-Xrs</tt>. Informatica is investigating this
problem.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If you use the current version of VMS (3.2.8), <b class="APPLICATION">LBM</b> 4.1
issues the following warning: <tt class="LITERAL">LOG Level 5: LBT-RDMA: VMS Logger
Message (Error): vmss_create_store: 196[E] vms_listen: rdma_bind_addr failed (r=-1)</tt>.
This warning indicates that <tt class="LITERAL">rdma_bind</tt> failed for ethernet
interfaces, which is expected behavior. Currently, VMS attempts <tt
class="LITERAL">rdma_bind</tt> on all interfaces. When released, VMS version 3.2.9 will
only run <tt class="LITERAL">rdma_bind</tt> on infiniband-capable interfaces.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>When using <a href="../Config/automaticmonitoringoptions.html" target="doccontent"><tt
class="LITERAL">Automatic Monitoring</tt></a> with <a
href="../Config/transportaccelerationoptions.html#CONTEXTUDACCELERATION"
target="doccontent"><tt class="LITERAL">ud_acceleration</tt></a> and the epoll file descriptor
option, <b class="APPLICATION">LBM</b> may leave a monitoring thread running after
context deletion. This situation produces the following error: <tt class="LITERAL">VMA
ERROR : epoll_wait_call:36:epoll_wait_call() epfd 48 not found</tt>. Informatica is
investigating this problem.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A requesting application using a UM Gateway may not receive the expected number of
responses. The problem occurs if the responses exceed the maximum datagram size, are
fragmented and the gateway must forward simultaneous fragmented responses. In this case
the fragments may become intermingled and result in a response not being delivered as
expected. The requesting application receives a warning similar to: <tt
class="LITERAL">WARNING: failed assertion [offset==0] at line 1627 in
../../../../src/lib/lbm/lbmqr.c</tt>. Informatica is investigating this problem.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>At the present time, 32-bit applications cannot interact with 64-bt applications using
the LBT-IPC transport. As a result, a 64-bit UM Gateway cannot interact with a 32-bit
application using LBT-IPC. It can only interact with a 64-bit application. Likewise, a
32-bit UM Gateway can only interact with a 32-bit application.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The UM Gateway does not currently support queuing at this time, only streaming and
persistence. This will be resolved in a future release.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The UM Gateway is not supported as a standalone Windows service at this time. This
will be resolved in a future release.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>When using the UM Gateway in a four gateway "full-mesh" configuration (i.e., all
gateways connected) the following instabilities have been observed.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Requesting applications can receive multiple or unending responses.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Restarting a single gateway has resulted in the crash of other gateways.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Running the same set of tests simultaneously in 2 opposite directions over a set of
gateways causes fatal asserts in the UM Gateways. Although this is not a typical user
configuration, more complex gateway configurations could simulate this effect. The UM
Gateway is designed to successfully forward the same set of topic messages sent both ways
across a set of gateways.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>These behaviors have not been seen in other, more typical gateway configurations.
Informatica is investigating this problem.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Under certain extreme conditions manufactured by configuring atypically low timeout
settings, the UM Gateway has been observed to terminate with various fatal assertions. We
believe this to be the result of a race condition exploited by the unusually low timer
settings. This issue has not been seen with less aggressive or default timer settings.
Informatica continues to investigate this problem.</p>

LBM_SRC_EVENT_UME_MESSAGE_RECLAIMED_EX, contains a new field,
LBM_SRC_EVENT_UME_MESSAGE_RECLAIMED_EX_FLAG_FORCED that <b class="APPLICATION">UME</b>
sets if the reclamation is a forced reclaim.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Added new configuration option, <a
href="../Config/ultramessagingpersistenceoptions.html#CONTEXTUMESESSIONID"
target="doccontent"><tt class="LITERAL">ume_session_id</tt></a> that specifies a Session ID for
a source, receiver or a context. A Session ID is a 64-bit value that uniquely identifies
any set of sources with unique topics and receivers with unique topics. A single Session
ID allows UME stores to correctly identify all the sources and receivers for a particular
application. See also <a href="../UME/designing-persistent-applications.html#SESSION-IDS"

<ul>
<li>
<p>Fixed a problem that could cause a fatal assert in a <b class="APPLICATION">UME</b>
store in a quorum/consensus configuration that uses a low <tt
class="LITERAL">source-activity-timeout</tt> setting when a source is rapidly added and
then deleted.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Fixed an issue with memory stores that could cause messages received by a store via

</li>

<li>
<p>Fixed a problem that allowed <b class="APPLICATION">UME</b> stores with <tt

</li>

<li>
<p>Fixed a problem that causes <b class="APPLICATION">UME</b> receivers to report
unrecoverable loss during recovery for messages that were unavailable at some stores, but

<div class="SECTION">
<h3 class="SECTION"><a id="UME3.2-KNOWNISSUES" name="UME3.2-KNOWNISSUES">27.2.3. Known

<ul>
<li>
<p>Receivers using event queues and Spectrum with <b class="APPLICATION">UME</b> can
experience a SIGSEGV while shutting down if events still exist on the event queue when it
is deleted. As a workaround, use LBM_EVQ_BLOCK when dispatching event queues. During
application shutdown, call <tt class="LITERAL">lbm_evq_unblock()</tt> after deleting
receivers associated with the event queue, but before deleting any context objects. Once
the dispatch thread exits, it is safe to proceed with context deletion. 29West is working

<h3 class="SECTION"><a id="UMQ2.1-NEW" name="UMQ2.1-NEW">27.3.1. New Features</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Implemented Indexed Queuing which allows sources to send messages with an index (an
unsigned 64-bit integer or a string up to 216 characters in length). The Queue assigns
all messages sent with a particular index to an individual receiver in each Application
Set. You can set policies for index assignment in the Queue's umestored XML configuration
file. See <a href="../UME/umeconcepts.html#INDEXED-QUEUING" target="doccontent">Indexed
Queuing</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Implemented a Dead Letter Queue feature to isolate unconsumed messages which prevents
these messages from causing application or queuing system problems. See <a
href="../UME/umeconcepts.html#DEAD-LETTER-QUEUE" target="doccontent">Dead Letter Queue</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Added the ability to set a message's total lifetime for both <b
class="APPLICATION">UMQ</b> and ULB sources. See <a
href="../UME/umeconcepts.html#MESSAGE-LIFETIMES" target="doccontent">Message Lifetimes</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Added <code class="FUNCTION">lbm_msg_umq_reassign()</code> in the <a
