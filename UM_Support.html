<h2 id="eol">End of Life Policy</h2>

<p>Ultra Messaging software continues to be enhanced.
New versions are made available periodically with new functionality
and performance improvements.
We at Informatica understand that our users may not be able to stay up-to-date
with each software version as it becomes available.
However, it is also not practical for Informatica to provide full support
for every version of its software that has ever been released.
Therefore, we have established the following "End of Life" policy (EOL) for
older UM software versions.
Note that this policy applies to Informatica's Ultra Messaging product only.

<ol>
<li><p>A UM version will be fully supported for a period no less than
five years after its initial release.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A "version" is identified by two numbers: a major and a minor version.
For example, 6.12 is a software version.</p>
<li><p>A "hotfix" is identified by three numbers: a major and a minor version,
and a hotfix number.
For example, 6.12.1 is "hotfix one" for version 6.12.</p>
<li><p>Hotfixes are not covered by the EOL policy.
When a new hotfix is released, it becomes the supported copy for
the underlying software version.
However, the 5-year minimum support period is calculated from the release
date of the original software version.
For example, the 6.12 software version will be eligible for EOL five years
after the date of 6.12's original release,
not the date of 6.12's most-recent hotfix.</p>
</ul>

<li><p>Informatica will announce "End of Life" (EOL) for UM versions no later than
18 months prior to the effective date of EOL.
This 18 month period is known as "EOL-pending".</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For example, UM version 6.8 was released in December of 2014.
The earliest that it's EOL could have been announced would have been
June of 2018.
However, as of December 2019, 6.8's EOL has not been announced.
It is fully supported.</p>
<li><p>If UM version 6.8's EOL is eventually announced,
it will be an additional 18 months before that EOL takes effect.</p>
<li><p>UM EOL announcements are made using the Informatica "Support Flash"
emails, and in the release notes of new software versions.
Users are advised to examine Support Flashes for Ultra Messaging news.
</ul>

<li><p>At Informatica's discretion, full support can be maintained for
software versions beyond the 5-year period.</p>
<ul>
<li></p>When a software version is older than the 5-year minimum, it is still
subject to the 18-month EOL-pending period.</p>
</ul>

<li><p>Informatica has the policy of providing "best effort" support for
UM software versions that are EOL.
This typically means investigating issues and providing workarounds.
However, except under very unusual circumstances, Emergency Bug Fixes (EBFs)
are not provided for EOL software.
Instead, an EBF might be applied to a more-recent fully-supported
software version, and the user would have to upgrade to that version.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For users running EOL version of UM, an important goal of ongoing
support should be to develop and execute an upgrade plan for the user.</p>
</ul>
</ol>

<h3>EOL</h3>

<p>All UM versions prior to UM version 6.0 are EOL.</p>

<p>If you are running an EOL version of UM, please contact UM Support
for assistance in developing and executing an upgrade plan.</p>

<h3>EOL Pending</h3>

<p>If you are running an EOL-pending version of UM, please contact UM Support
for assistance in developing and executing an upgrade plan.</p>

<p>No UM versions are currently announced.</p>
