<h3>Publisher Restart</h3>

<p>
By publisher restart, we mean that a publishing application
exits (perhaps abnormally, as with a crash) and then restarts
with the same session ID to continue where
the previous instance left off.
Subscribers should see a continuous series of messages.
</p>

<p>
According to the original design of UM Persistence,
a restarting publisher is responsible for any messages
that were in flight when the previous instance exited.
In most cases, all messages sent will be successfully received
by subscribers and Stores,
and when the publisher restarts,
it can simply resume sending new messages.
However, packet loss is always a possibility.
If the Stores experience packet loss at the
same time that the publisher restarts,
UM cannot retransmit those lost packets.
</p>

<p>
Even without packet loss, it is possible for a publisher to
crash after it has decided to send the message but
before the UM send function can get the packet on the
network.
I.e., a message should be thought of as "in-flight" even before UM's send
function is invoked.
Once a publisher has decided to send a message, it is in flight.
</p>

<h4>Loss at Stores</h4>

<p>
This case assumes that one or more of the final messages sent by the
pre-crash publisher were not successfully received by any Store.
In the worst case, an entire flight size worth of messages might
have been lost.
</p>

<p>
When the publisher restarts and registers with the Stores,
the Stores will tell the publisher which message sequence
number to start at (see
<a href="https://ultramessaging.github.io/currdoc/doc/Config/grpultramessagingpersistence.html#umeconsensussequencenumberbehaviorsource">ume_consensus_sequence_number_behavior (source)</a>).
According to the original design of UM Persistence,
the publisher has a responsibility to detect when that sequence number has
already been sent, and if so, to re-send the previously-sent messages starting
at that sequence number.
In the worst case, an entire flight size worth of messages might need to be
re-sent.
(But see <a href="#publisher_cant_resend">Publisher Can't Resend</a>.)
</p>

<p>
For example, suppose a publisher sends 50 messages, with sequence numbers
0-49, and then crashes.
Let's further suppose that the last ten messages (40-49) were lost to all
Stores, but the subscribers successfully received them.
In this case, when the publisher restarts and re-registers,
it will be told to start at sequence number 40.
The publisher should re-send the same ten messages it previously sent for
sequence numbers 40-49.
Then the publisher can start sending new messages.
</p>

<p>
See <a href="#publisher_design">Publisher Design</a> for suggestions on
how to satisfy this publisher requirement.
</p>

<p>
When this case happens, subscribers that successfully received the
messages that the Stores lost can see one of two behaviors
while the publisher re-sends the previously sent messages:
<ol>
<li>
For UM versions prior to 6.13, the re-sent messages are <b>not</b> delivered
to the subscribing application. They are dropped by the UM receiver as
duplicates.
</li>
<li>
For UM versions 6.13 and beyond, the re-sent messages <b>are</b> delivered
to the subscribing application.
The subscriber must be able to detect that they were previously processed,
and act accordingly.
See <a href="receiver_duplicates">Receiver Duplicates</a>.
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<a id="publisher_cant_resend"></a>
<h4>Publisher Can't Resend</h4>

<p>
Over the years, Informatica has come to know that many of our users have
not designed their publishers to be able to re-send previously-sent messages.
When their publishers re-register,
they start sending new messages without regard to the starting
sequence number.
</p>

<p>
Most of the time, this publisher design does not have any problem.
It is rare for packet loss to happen at the exact time that a publisher
crashes.
However, it has occasionally happened,
and depending on the version of UM,
can lead to temporary subscriber deafness to those new messages.
</p>

<p>
For example, suppose a publisher sends 50 messages,
with sequence numbers 0-49, and then crashes.
Let's further suppose that the last ten messages
(40-49) were lost to all Stores,
but the subscribers successfully received them.
In this case, when the publisher restarts and re-registers,
it will be told to start at sequence number 40.
The publisher is <i>supposed</i> to re-send the same ten
messages it previously sent for sequence numbers 40-49.
But in this scenario, the publisher is not designed for that,
so it sends new messages for sequence numbers 40-49.
Note that the message sequence numbers 40-49 no longer
represent single, unique messages.
</p>

<p>
For subscribers running UM versions prior to 6.13,
those ten new messages with old sequence numbers will
be dropped by the UM receiver.
That is, the subscribing application will be "deaf" to them.
This is not desired since those messages are new.
</p>

<p>
For UM versions 6.13 and beyond,
the new messages with old sequence numbers
<b>are</b> delivered to the subscribing application.
The subscriber must be able to detect if they were previously processed,
and act accordingly.
See <a href="receiver_duplicates">Receiver Duplicates</a>.
</p>

<p>
Although the 6.13 change works around this temporary deafness problem,
there are other failure cases that result in bad behavior.
For example,
if a subscriber has been down during this period and then
comes back up and requests recovery,
it can only get messages that are on the Stores.
It will recover 40-49 as the new messages,
with the pre-crash messages permanently lost.
There will be no indication that it missed the last ten messages
from the publisher's pre-crash execution.
</p>

<p>
Informatica recommends designing publishing applications to re-send
previously-sent messages if requested to do so by the Store.
See <a href="#publisher_design">Publisher Design</a> for suggestions on
how to satisfy this publisher requirement.
</p>

<a id="subscriber_reregister"></a>
<h3>Subscriber Re-register</h3>

<p>
A registered subscriber sometimes has to register with the Stores again.
Perhaps this is because the publisher restarted.
Or maybe the Stores restarted.
Or the subscriber application itself had to restart
(perhaps abnormally, as with a crash).
</p>

<p>
According to the original design of UM Persistence,
a re-registering subscriber is responsible for detecting
"duplicate messages".
That is, messages that it had already received and processed from
before the re-registration.
</p>

<p>
In typical use,
the Store remembers the last message the subscriber processed.
It keeps track of this by the "consumption acknowledgments" that
the subscribing application sends.
When a subscriber re-registers with the Store,
the Store will (by default) deliver all messages after the last
successfully-acknowledged message.
</p>

<p>
However,
the Stores cannot have perfect knowledge of a subscriber's state.
For example,
a subscriber might have just processed message 49 and is in the process
of sending a consumption acknowledgment to the Store,
when the subscriber application suddenly crashes.
When the subscriber restarts and re-registers,
message 49 will (by default) be re-delivered to the application.
The subscriber has a responsibility to detect this duplicate message,
and act accordingly.
</p>

<p>
For high-throughput applications,
the subscriber is typically designed to batch many consumption
acknowledgments together.
This increases the chances that a crashed subscriber will
get multiple duplicates.
</p>

<p>
See <a href="#subscriber_design">Subscriber Design</a> for suggestions on
how to satisfy this subscriber requirement.
</p>

<p>
This requirement becomes more complicated if the publishing
application restarts and is unable to re-send previously-sent messages
(see <a href="#publisher_cant_resend">Publisher Can't Resend</a>).
In that case, a message sequence number might not represent a single
unique application message.
The subscriber might use message content to detect duplicates.
